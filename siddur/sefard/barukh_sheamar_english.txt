Blessed is He Who spoke, and the world came into being, blessed is He; blessed is He Who says and does; blessed is He Who decrees and fulfills; blessed is He Who maintains the creation; blessed is He Who has compassion on the earth; blessed is He Who has compassion on the creatures; blessed is He Who rewards well those who fear Him, blessed is He Who lives forever and exists eternally; blessed is He Who redeems and saves, blessed is His Name. Blessed are You, Adonoy, our God, King of the Universe, the Almighty, the merciful Father, Who is verbally extolled by His people, praised and glorified by the tongue of His pious ones, and His servants, and through the songs of David Your servant. We will extoll You, Adonoy our God, with praises and psalms; we will exalt, praise, and glorify You; we will crown and mention Your Name, our King, our God. Unique One, Life of the worlds, King, praised and glorified forever is His great Name. Blessed are You, Adonoy, King, Who is extolled with praises.
