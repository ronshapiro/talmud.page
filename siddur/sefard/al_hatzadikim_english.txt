Upon the righteous, upon the pious, upon the elders of the remnants of Your people the House of Israel, upon the remnant of their scholars, upon the true proselytes, and upon us, may Your mercy be aroused, Adonoy our God. Grant bountiful reward to all who trust in Your Name in truth; and place our lot among them, and may we never be put to shame, for in You we have put our trust and in Your great compassion we have been supported. Blessed are You, Adonoy, Support and Trust of the righteous.
