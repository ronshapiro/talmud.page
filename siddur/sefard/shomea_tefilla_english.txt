Merciful Father Hear our voice, Adonoy, our God; spare us and have compassion on us, and accept our prayers compassionately and willingly, for You are Almighty Who hears prayers and supplications; and from Your Presence, our King, do not turn us away empty-handed, be gracious and answer us and hear our prayer for You hear the prayers of every mouth (of Your people, Israel, with compassion). Blessed are You, Adonoy, Who hears prayers.
