For informers let there be no hope and may all heretics instantly perish may all enemies of Your nation be swiftly cut off, and the insolent may You quickly uproot, crush, rout, disgrace and humbled and subdue speedily in our days. Blessed are You, Adonoy, Crusher of enemies and Subduer of the insolent.
