      "§ The mishna stated that <b>Rabbi Meir said: An incident</b> occurred <b>involving a certain</b> individual <b>who fell into the Great Cistern</b> and emerged after three days. It <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>They said to Rabbi Meir: One does not mention miraculous acts</b> to teach general <i>halakha</i>. The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> about that story defines it as an example of <b>miraculous acts? If we say</b> the fact <b>that he did not eat or drink</b> for three days and still survived is miraculous, <b>but isn’t it written: “Fast for me, and neither eat nor drink</b> three days, night or day” (Esther 4:16), demonstrating that one may survive this experience naturally?",
      "The Gemara answers: <b>Rather,</b> the miraculous element is <b>that he did not sleep</b> during those three days, <b>as Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> If one says: I hereby take on <b>an oath that I will not sleep for three days,</b> the court <b>flogs him</b> for taking an oath in vain, <b>and he may sleep immediately</b> because it is impossible to remain awake for three consecutive days.",
      "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> according to <b>Rabbi Meir, what is the reason</b> this was not a miraculous incident? The Gemara answers that <b>Rav Kahana said: There were</b> several levels of <b>arches</b> built <b>on top of</b> other <b>arches</b> within the Great Cistern, and he supported himself on the arches and slept. <b>And the Rabbis</b> said that <b>they were</b> made <b>of marble</b> and it was impossible to hold onto them and sleep. <b>And Rabbi Meir</b> assumed that <b>it is inconceivable that he didn’t grasp</b> some part of an arch for a short time <b>and sleep a little,</b> and therefore this incident does not qualify as a miracle.",
      "<b>The Sages taught: An incident</b> occurred <b>involving the daughter of Neḥunya the well digger, who fell into the Great Cistern, and they came and notified Rabbi Ḥanina ben Dosa</b> and asked that he pray for her. After <b>the first hour, he said to them:</b> She is at <b>peace</b> and unharmed. After <b>the second</b> hour, <b>he said to them:</b> She is at <b>peace.</b> After <b>the third</b> hour <b>he said to them: She has ascended</b> from the cistern.",
      "When she came to Rabbi Ḥanina ben Dosa, <b>he said to her: My daughter, who pulled you up</b> from the cistern? <b>She said to him: A male sheep,</b> i.e., a ram, <b>happened by</b> and sensed <b>me</b> in that cistern, <b>and</b> there was <b>an old man leading him</b> who pulled me out. <b>They said</b> to Rabbi Ḥanina ben Dosa: <b>Are you a prophet</b> with knowledge of what is happening far away? <b>He said to them,</b> using a figure of speech from the Bible: <b>“I am not a prophet, nor the son of a prophet am I”</b> (Amos 7:14). <b>Rather,</b> I reasoned as follows: Could it be that concerning <b>the endeavor that the righteous</b> Neḥunya <b>is engaged</b> in, i.e., digging for the benefit of the public, <b>his offspring would stumble upon</b> its fruits and thereby be killed? I therefore knew that God would certainly save her.",
      "<b>Rabbi Abba said: Even so, the son</b> of Neḥunya the well digger <b>died of thirst,</b> and the merit of his father, who attended to the water supply, did not protect him, <b>as is stated: “And around Him it storms [<i>nisara</i>] mightily”</b> (Psalms 50:3), <b>which teaches that the Holy One, Blessed be He, is exacting with His surroundings,</b> i.e., the righteous who are close to Him, <b>up to a hairsbreadth [<i>sa’ara</i>],</b> so that even slight deviations can elicit severe punishment. <b>Rabbi Ḥanina said:</b> This idea is derived <b>from here: “A God dreaded in the great council of the holy ones, and feared by all that are about Him”</b> (Psalms 89:8). This indicates that God is most feared by those that are nearest to Him, i.e., the righteous, because He is more exacting of them."

      "§ <b>The Master said</b> in listing the miracles that even strong winds were unable to displace <b>the smoke of the arrangement of wood.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And did smoke</b> rise from <b>the arrangement of wood</b> on the altar? <b>But wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: There were <b>five matters stated with regard to the fire of the arrangement of wood: It crouched</b> above the wood <b>like a lion; and it was</b> as <b>clear</b> as the light of the <b>sun; and it had substance</b> to the extent that it could be felt; it was powerful enough <b>to consume wet</b> wood <b>like dry</b> wood; <b>and it did not raise smoke.</b>",
      "The Gemara answers: <b>When we said</b> that the smoke was not displaced, indicating that the wood produced smoke, that was in reference to the fire brought by a <b>person, as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“And the sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire upon the altar”</b> (Leviticus 1:7), indicating that <b>even though fire descends from the heavens,</b> still there is a special <b>mitzva to bring fire by a person.</b> The fire that the priests brought produced smoke, and the miracle related to that smoke.",
      "The Gemara asks: And was the altar’s fire <b>crouched like a lion? But wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Ḥanina, the deputy</b> High <b>Priest, said: I saw</b> the fire in the Temple and it was <b>crouched like a dog</b> and not a lion? The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult. Here,</b> where the <i>baraita</i> stated that the fire resembled a lion, it refers to the fire in the <b>First Temple; there,</b> where Rabbi Ḥanina, the deputy High Priest, said that the fire resembled a dog, it refers to the fire in the <b>Second Temple.</b>",
      "The Gemara asks: <b>And was there</b> fire that descended from the heavens <b>in the Second Temple? Didn’t Rav Shmuel bar Inya say: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written</b> with regard to the Second Temple: “Go up to the hills and get wood and build the house; <b>and I will look on it favorably and I will be glorified [<i>ve’ekkaved</i>],</b> said the Lord” (Haggai 1:8)? Even though it is written <i>ve’ekkaved</i>, <b>we read it <i>ve’ikkavda</i>,</b> with an added letter <i>heh</i>. The Gemara explains: <b>What is different</b> that the word is <b>missing</b> the letter <b><i>heh</i>? This</b> represents <b>five,</b> the numerological value of <i>heh</i>, <b>phenomena</b> that constituted the difference <b>between</b> the <b>First Temple</b> and the <b>Second Temple,</b> in that they were not in the Second Temple. <b>And these are: The Ark</b> of the Covenant, <b>and the Ark cover</b> upon it, <b>and the cherubs</b> that were on the Ark cover; <b>fire; and</b> the <b>Divine Presence; and the Divine Spirit; and the <i>Urim VeTummim</i>.</b> Apparently, there was no fire from heaven in the Second Temple. The Sages <b>say</b> in response: <b>Yes, there was</b> fire from heaven in the Second Temple; however, <b>it did not assist</b> in burning the offerings but was merely visible above the wood.",
      "Apropos the fire on the altar, the Gemara cites a related <i>baraita</i>. <b>The Sages taught</b> that <b>there are six kinds of fire: There is</b> fire that <b>consumes solids and does not consume liquids; and there is</b> fire that <b>consumes liquids and does not consume solids; and there is</b> fire that <b>consumes solids and consumes liquids; and there is</b> fire that <b>consumes wet</b> objects <b>like dry</b> objects; <b>and there is fire that repels</b> other <b>fire; and there is fire that consumes</b> other <b>fire.</b>",
      "The Gemara elaborates: <b>There is fire that consumes solids and does not consume liquids; that is our</b> standard fire that consumes dry items but does not dry liquids. <br/>Fire that <b>consumes liquids and does not consume solids</b> is the fever <b>of the sick</b> that dehydrates the body but does not consume the flesh. <br/>Fire that <b>consumes solids and consumes liquids</b> is the fire <b>of Elijah</b> the Prophet, <b>as it is written:</b> “And fire fell from the sky and consumed the offering and the wood and the stones and the earth, <b>and it licked up the water that was in the trench”</b> (I Kings 18:38). <br/>Fire that <b>consumes wet</b> objects <b>like dry</b> objects is the fire <b>of the arrangement of wood.</b> <br/><b>There is fire that repels</b> other <b>fire;</b> that is the fire <b>of</b> the angel <b>Gabriel.</b> The book of Daniel relates that Gabriel was an angel of fire who descended to the fiery furnace, repelled the fire, and rescued Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, who had been cast inside. <br/><b>And there is fire that consumes</b> other <b>fire;</b> that is the fire <b>of the Divine Presence, as the Master said</b> in another context: The Holy One, Blessed be He, <b>extended His finger</b> between the angels, who are also made of fire, <b>and burned them.</b> The fire of the Divine Presence consumed the fire of the angels."

      "§ The Gemara analyzes the above <i>baraita</i>. <b>The Master said</b> in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>And from where</b> is it derived <b>that he includes a smoke-raiser in its</b> spices? <b>The verse states: “And it shall cover”</b> (Leviticus 16:13). The Gemara expresses surprise at this statement: One <b>verse for</b> another <b>verse?</b> The requirement of a smoke-raiser was already proven from the verse: “For I will appear in a cloud upon the Ark cover” (Leviticus 16:2); why cite a second verse in support of the first one?",
      "<b>Rav Yosef said: This is</b> what the <i>baraita</i> <b>said;</b> this is how to understand the matter: <b>I have</b> derived <b>nothing other</b> than the obligation to bring <b>a leaf of a smoke-raising</b> plant. <b>From where</b> is it derived that he must also bring <b>a root of a smoke-raiser? The verse states: “And it shall cover,”</b> which indicates the requirement for more of the smoke-raiser than might have been supposed from the other verse.",
      "<b>Abaye said</b> to Rav Yosef: Your interpretation indicates that the leaf of the smoke-raiser raises smoke better than its root, as the requirement for a root is merely considered an addition. <b>But wasn’t the opposite taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>? <b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>He put into</b> the incense <b>a root of a smoke-raiser,</b> and the smoke <b>would rise in a column like a staff until it reached</b> the Temple <b>ceiling. When it reached</b> the <b>ceiling</b> there was nowhere for the smoke to exit the building, and therefore it slowly <b>descended the walls until the</b> entire <b>House was filled with smoke, as it is stated: “And the House was filled with smoke”</b> (Isaiah 6:4). This <i>baraita</i> indicates that the root of the smoke-raiser raises smoke better than its leaf.",
      "<b>Rather, Abaye said</b> that <b>this is</b> what the <i>baraita</i> <b>said;</b> this is how it should be understood: <b>I have</b> derived <b>nothing other</b> than the obligation to bring <b>a root of a smoke-raising</b> plant. <b>From where</b> is it derived that he must also bring <b>a leaf of a smoke-raiser? The verse states: “And it shall cover.”</b>",
      "<b>Rav Sheshet said</b> that the <i>baraita</i> means the following: <b>I have</b> derived <b>nothing other</b> than the inclusion of a smoke-raiser amongst the other spices in <b>the Tent of Meeting that</b> was <b>in the wilderness; from where</b> is it derived that this obligation extends to the Tabernacle at <b>Shiloh and</b> in <b>the eternal Temple</b> in Jerusalem? <b>The verse states: “And it shall cover,”</b> which indicates that wherever the High Priest enters the Holy of Holies to burn incense, he must include a smoke-raiser in its ingredients.",
      "The Gemara raises a difficulty with regard to this interpretation: <b>This</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>is derived from</b> the verse: <b>“And so shall he do for the Tent of Meeting that dwells with them”</b> (Leviticus 16:16). This verse teaches that this rite must be performed not only that first time in the wilderness, but wherever the Divine Presence dwells.",
      "<b>Rather, this is</b> what the <i>baraita</i> <b>said: I have</b> derived <b>nothing other</b> than the obligation to include a smoke-raiser in the spices of the incense offered <b>on Yom Kippur</b> in the Holy of Holies; <b>from where</b> is it derived that this obligation applies to the incense offered <b>on the rest of the days of the year</b> in the Sanctuary? <b>The verse states: “And it shall cover,”</b> to teach that every incense burned in the Temple must include a smoke-raiser.",
      "<b>Rav Ashi said: One</b> verse teaches us <b>the mitzva</b> itself, <b>and one</b> verse teaches that this requirement is <b>indispensable,</b> i.e., the rite is invalid if one omits this ingredient. <b>Rava said: One</b> verse teaches that the omission of the smoke-raiser renders one liable to receive the <b>punishment</b> of death, <b>and one</b> verse serves <b>as a warning</b> that it is prohibited to omit it, as the Torah does not require punishment without issuing a warning.",
      "§ <b>It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> “Speak to Aaron your brother that he should not come at all times into the sacred place within the curtain, before the Ark cover that is upon the Ark; <b>that he not die”</b> (Leviticus 16:2). This verse teaches the <b>punishment</b> for the omission of the smoke-raiser from the spices of the incense. With regard to the verse: <b>“For I will appear in a cloud</b> upon the Ark cover” (Leviticus 16:2); this is the <b>warning</b> that it is prohibited to omit the smoke-raiser, which causes the cloud to rise.",
      "One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>both</b> verses <b>were said before the deaths of Aaron’s sons,</b> who died upon entering the sacred place. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “After the deaths of the two sons of Aaron”</b> (Leviticus 16:1). One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>both of them,</b> the punishment and the warning, <b>were said after the deaths of Aaron’s two sons.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “For I will appear in a cloud upon the Ark cover</b>.” <b>How so;</b> how should these verses be understood? The <b>warning</b> was said <b>before</b> the <b>death</b> of Aaron’s sons, <b>and the punishment</b> associated with it was stated <b>after the death</b> of his sons.",
      "The Gemara expresses puzzlement at Rabbi Eliezer’s statement: <b>What is the</b> biblical <b>derivation?</b> How does Rabbi Eliezer learn from the phrase “I will appear” that the warning was stated earlier? <b>Rava said</b> that <b>the verse states: “For I will appear in a cloud”;</b> the future tense indicates that the cloud over the Ark cover <b>had not yet appeared,</b> as the Tabernacle had not been built, which means that this command was issued before Aaron’s sons entered and died. The Gemara asks: <b>Rather, what is the reason</b> that Aaron’s sons <b>were punished</b> with death, if the punishment had not been stated? The Torah does not punish one who is unaware of the sin’s punishment.",
      "The Gemara answers: They were not punished for their entry into the sacred place but for a different reason, <b>as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: Aaron’s sons died only because they taught a <i>halakha</i> before Moses their teacher;</b> they should have asked him for his ruling, but they neglected to do so. The Gemara asks: <b>What did they interpret</b> from the verse that led them to enter the sacred place with fire? The verse states: <b>“And the sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire upon the altar”</b> (Leviticus 1:7), which indicates that <b>although fire descends from the heavens,</b> it is a <b>mitzva to bring man-made</b> fire. To fulfill this mitzva, Aaron’s sons entered and brought fire to the altar. Although their ruling was in accordance with the <i>halakha</i>, they incurred the death penalty for failing to ask Moses."
