    "en": "<b>“Remember my affliction and my anguish, wormwood and gall” (Lamentations 3:19).</b><br/>“Remember my affliction and my anguish [<i>umrudi</i>]” – the congregation of Israel says before the Holy One blessed be He: Master of the universe, remember the afflictions with which I was afflicted, the rebellion [<i>umrudi</i>] that I carried out against You, and the suffering with which You sated me, “wormwood and gall.” These are expiated by those.<br/><b>“You will remember, and my soul is despondent within me” (Lamentations 3:20).</b><br/>“You will remember” – Rabbi Ḥiyya taught: This is analogous to a king who went out to war. His sons were with him and were provoking him. The next day, the king went out alone and his sons were not with him. The king said: If only my sons were with me, even if they would be provoking me. So too, the king is the Holy One blessed be He, and His sons are Israel. When Israel would go out to war, the Holy One blessed be He would go out with them. When they angered Him, He did not go out with them. But when Israel was no longer in the Land [of Israel], He said: If only Israel was with Me, even if they would be angering Me. We have three verses: “Would that I would be in the wilderness, in a wayfarers’ lodging place” (Jeremiah 9:1); would that My people be with Me as they were at the outset, when they were in the wilderness. And it is written: “Son of man, the house of Israel dwelled in their land…” (Ezekiel 36:17). And this, “You will remember, and My soul is despondent within Me.”<br/>Rabbi Yudan said: “You will remember” – I know that You remember the nations of the world. But what can I do, “my soul is despondent within me.” The parable says: Until the fat one grows lean, the soul of the lean one expires.<br/><b>“This I will reply to my heart; therefore I have hope” (Lamentations 3:21).</b><br/>“This I will reply to my heart; therefore I have hope” – Rabbi Abba bar Kahana said in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan: To what is this matter analogous? To a king who married a noblewoman and wrote for her a very substantial marriage contract, saying to her: ‘I will prepare for you such and such number of wedding canopies, and I am giving you such and such number of gowns of purple wool.’ The king left her and went to a country overseas, and he was delayed there. Her neighbors came to her and were teasing her and saying to her: ‘The king left you, went to a country overseas, and he is not going to return to you.’ She was crying and sighing. When she would enter her house, she would take her marriage contract and read it. She would see in her marriage contract: I will prepare such and such number of wedding canopies, and I am giving you such and such number of gowns of purple wool, and she would be immediately comforted. Ultimately, the king came. He said to her: ‘My daughter, I am astonished, how did you wait for me all those years?’ She said to him: ‘My lord, the king, were it not for the substantial marriage contract that you wrote and gave to me, my neighbors would have caused my demise.’ So too, idolaters provoke Israel and say to them: ‘Your God has concealed His face from You and caused His Divine Presence to depart from you. He will never return to you.’ They cry and sigh. When they enter the synagogues and study halls, read the Torah, and find that it is written: “I will turn to you, and make you fruitful.… I will place My Sanctuary in your midst.… I will walk in your midst” (Leviticus 26:9, 11–12), they are comforted. Tomorrow, when the end of the redemption comes, the Holy One blessed be He will say to Israel: ‘My children, I am astonished over you, how did you wait for Me all those years?’ They will say before Him: ‘Master of the universe, were it not for Your Torah that You gave us, the nations would have caused our demise.’ That is why it is stated: “This (<i>zot</i>) I will reply to my heart,” and <i>zot</i> is nothing other than Torah, as it is stated: “And this [<i>vezot</i>] is the Torah” (Deuteronomy 4:44). Likewise, David said: “Had Your Torah not been my delight, I would have perished in my affliction” (Psalms 119:92). “Therefore I have hope” in Him, and we proclaim the unity of His name twice daily and say: “Hear Israel, the Lord is our God, the Lord is one” (Deuteronomy 6:4).",

      "<b>Rava said: A Torah scholar may examine</b> a knife <b>for himself</b> and use it for slaughtering, without having to show it to the local Sage. The Gemara relates that <b>Ravina happened</b> to come <b>to Meḥoza,</b> the home town of Rava. <b>His host brought</b> out <b>a knife</b> for slaughtering <b>and showed</b> it <b>to him.

      "The host <b>said to him: Doesn’t the Master hold</b> in accordance with <b>that</b> which <b>Rava said: A Torah scholar may examine</b> a slaughtering knife <b>for himself?</b> In this case I am using the knife to slaughter on your behalf. Ravina <b>said to him:</b> Since <b>I</b> am only <b>buying</b> the meat <b>from you,</b> it is not considered as though I am slaughtering for myself. Rava’s principle does not apply to such a case.",
      "The Gemara cites a mnemonic for the names of the Sages mentioned in the following discussion: <b><i>Zila Lehanya</i>:</b> Rabbi Elazar from Hagronya; <b><i>Maḥlif</i>:</b> Rav Abba bar Taḥalifa; <b><i>Ika</i>:</b> Rav Aḥa bar Ika; <b>and <i>Ya’akov</i>:</b> Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov.",
      "The Gemara now relates that <b>Rabbi Elazar from Hagronya and Rav Abba bar Taḥalifa happened</b> to come <b>to the house</b> of <b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Ika, in the place</b> of jurisdiction <b>of Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov. Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Ika, wanted to prepare for them a third-born calf,</b> whose meat was considered a delicacy. <b>He brought</b> out a slaughtering <b>knife and showed</b> it <b>to them.</b>",
      "<b>Rav Aḥa bar Taḥalifa said to them: Should we not be concerned with</b> the respect of <b>the Elder,</b> Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov, and present the knife to him for inspection, as this is his town? <b>Rabbi Elazar from Hagronya said to them:</b> That is unnecessary, since <b>Rava said as follows: A Torah scholar may examine</b> a knife <b>for himself. Rabbi Elazar from Hagronya</b> then <b>inspected</b> the knife, <b>but he was</b> later <b>punished</b> at the hand of Heaven for disregarding the honor of the senior rabbi.",
      "The Gemara expresses surprise: What was Rabbi Elazar from Hagronya’s mistake? <b>Didn’t Rava say: A Torah scholar may examine</b> a slaughtering knife <b>for himself?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>It was different there, as they had</b> already <b>begun</b> to discuss the issue <b>of the honor</b> of Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov. Had the name of Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov never arisen, they would have been permitted to examine the knife themselves. Once his name had been mentioned, however, they should have approached him with the knife. Their failure to do so is considered a display of disrespect.",
      "<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead: <b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov is different, as he was illustrious</b> in age and wisdom, and thus deserved more honor than a regular Sage.",
      "<b>Rava said:</b> Even though it is ordinarily prohibited for a disciple to issue a halakhic ruling in his teacher’s place, if he does so <b>in order to separate</b> another person <b>from a prohibition</b> he is committing, <b>even in</b> his teacher’s <b>presence it seems well,</b> i.e., it is permitted. The Gemara relates that <b>Ravina was</b> once <b>sitting before Rav Ashi</b> when <b>he saw a certain man tying his donkey to a palm tree on Shabbat,</b> in violation of the decree of the Sages against utilizing trees on Shabbat. <b>He raised his voice to him</b> in protest, <b>but</b> the man <b>paid him no attention.</b> Ravina then <b>said to</b> Rav Ashi: <b>Let this man be in excommunication</b> for transgressing the words of the Sages and ignoring a scholar’s rebuke.",
      "Afterward, Ravina <b>said to</b> Rav Ashi: Behavior <b>such as this,</b> the way I acted in your presence just now, <b>does</b> it <b>appear like irreverent</b> behavior? Rav Ashi <b>said to him:</b> With regard to this it is stated: <b>“There is no wisdom or understanding or council against the Lord”</b> (Proverbs 21:30). The Sages expounded this verse as follows: <b>Wherever a desecration of</b> God’s <b>name is involved, no respect is paid</b> even <b>to a teacher,</b> i.e., in such a situation one should disregard the respect due to his teacher’s wisdom and understanding and object to the inappropriate behavior.",
      "<b>Rava said:</b> With regard to one who issues a halakhic ruling in his teacher’s location without the intention of preventing someone from violating a prohibition, the following distinction applies: <b>In</b> the teacher’s actual <b>presence,</b> the disciple <b>is prohibited</b> to issue such a ruling, <b>and</b> if he does so, he <b>is liable</b> to receive the <b>death</b> penalty at the hand of Heaven. However, when he is <b>not in his</b> actual <b>presence,</b> the disciple <b>is</b> still <b>prohibited</b> to issue the ruling, <b>but he is not liable</b> to receive the <b>death</b> penalty.",
      "The Gemara asks: Is the disciple <b>not</b> liable to receive the death penalty if he issues his ruling <b>not in</b> the teacher’s <b>presence? But wasn’t</b> it <b>taught</b> otherwise in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: The sons of Aaron died only because they issued a halakhic ruling before Moses, their teacher? What did they expound</b> in support of their conclusion that they must bring fire inside as opposed to waiting for fire to come down from the heavens? It is stated in the Torah: <b>“And the sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire on the altar,</b> and lay the wood in order on the fire” (Leviticus 1:7), which led <b>them</b> to <b>say: Although fire descends from Heaven,</b> it is nonetheless <b>a mitzva to bring ordinary</b> fire. Although they derived this from the verses, they were punished for ruling in the presence of their teacher.",
      "It was further related that <b>Rabbi Eliezer had a certain disciple who issued a</b> halakhic <b>ruling in his presence. Rabbi Eliezer said to his wife, Imma Shalom: I will be surprised if this one completes his year,</b> i.e., if he lives until the end of the year. <b>And</b> so it was, <b>he did not complete his year.</b>",
      "His wife <b>said to him: Are you a prophet?</b> He <b>said to her: I am not a prophet, nor the son of a prophet, but I have received the following</b> tradition: <b>Anyone who issues a halakhic ruling in his teacher’s presence is liable</b> to receive the <b>death</b> penalty.",
      "<b>And Rabba bar bar Ḥana said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: That disciple was named Yehuda ben Gurya, and he was three parasangs away from</b> Rabbi Eliezer. Apparently, one is liable for the death penalty even if he did not issue his ruling in his teacher’s presence.",
      "The Gemara answers: In fact, the incident <b>took place in</b> the actual <b>presence</b> of the teacher, which is why the disciple was punished. The distance mentioned refers to the distance between the student’s usual place and the teacher. The Gemara expresses surprise: <b>But didn’t</b> Rabba bar bar Ḥana <b>say that he was three parasangs away from</b> his teacher?
