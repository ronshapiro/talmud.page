    "en": "One who <b>was reading</b> a sacred <b>book</b> in scroll form on Shabbat <b>on</b> an elevated, wide <b>threshold, and the book rolled from his hand</b> into the public domain, <b>he</b> may <b>roll it</b> back <b>to himself,</b> since one of its ends remains in his hand. If <b>he was reading on top the roof,</b> which is a full-fledged private domain, <b>and the book rolled from his hand, as long as</b> the edge of the book <b>did not reach</b> within <b>ten handbreadths</b> above the public domain, the book is still in its own domain, and he may <b>roll it</b> back <b>to himself.</b> However, <b>once the book has reached</b> within <b>ten handbreadths</b> above the public domain, it is prohibited to roll the book back to oneself. In that case, <b>he</b> may only <b>turn it</b> over <b>onto the</b> side with <b>writing,</b> so that the writing of the book will be facedown and not exposed and degraded. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: Even</b> if the scroll <b>is removed only a needle breadth from the ground, he rolls it</b> back <b>to himself. Rabbi Shimon says: Even if</b> the scroll is <b>on the ground itself, he rolls it</b> back <b>to himself, as you have nothing</b> that was instituted <b>as a rabbinic decree</b> to enhance the character of Shabbat as a day of <b>rest</b> that <b>stands</b> as an impediment <b>before</b> the rescue of <b>sacred writings.</b>",
