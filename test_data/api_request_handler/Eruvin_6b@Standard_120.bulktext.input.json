        "<b>Rav Pappa raises an objection</b> against Ḥizkiyya’s opinion from that which is taught in a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>one robbed</b> another <b>of a coin and</b> afterward the coin <b>was rendered invalid</b> by the government, or if he robbed another of <b><i>teruma</i> and it became</b> ritually <b>impure,</b> or if he robbed another of <b>leavened bread and Passover</b> then <b>elapsed over it,</b> rendering it forbidden, in each of these cases the robber <b>can</b> return the item and <b>say to</b> the robbery victim: <b>That which is yours is before you.</b> Since the robber returned the stolen item, he is not required to compensate the victim of the robbery for his monetary loss, although the stolen items are currently of minimal or no value.",
        "<b>And if you say</b> that <b>damage that is not evident is categorized</b> as <b>damage,</b> then <b>this</b> man <b>is a robber,</b> and <b>he should be required to pay full compensation</b> for the damage he caused. The Gemara concludes: This is <b>a conclusive refutation,</b> and the opinion of Ḥizkiyya is rejected.",
        "The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say</b> that this amoraic dispute is <b>parallel to</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>,</b> as it was taught in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>one who renders</b> another’s food ritually <b>impure, or one who mixes</b> <i>teruma</i> with another’s non-sacred produce, <b>or one who pours</b> another’s wine as a libation before an idol, <b>whether</b> he did so <b>unintentionally or intentionally,</b> he is <b>liable</b> to pay for the damage he caused; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> If he acted <b>unintentionally,</b> he is <b>exempt;</b> if he acted <b>intentionally,</b> he is <b>liable</b> to pay.",
        "The Gemara suggests: <b>What, is it not</b> that <b>they disagree about this</b> very issue? <b>As</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Meir, <b>holds</b> that <b>damage that is not evident is</b> nevertheless <b>categorized</b> as <b>damage.</b> Consequently, one is liable to pay even if he caused the damage unintentionally. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yehuda, <b>holds</b> that such damage <b>is not categorized</b> as <b>damage,</b> and consequently one is liable to pay only if he caused the damage intentionally, as this is a rabbinically instituted fine.",
        "<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said</b> that it is possible to say that <b>everyone,</b> including Rabbi Meir, <b>agrees that damage that is not evident is not categorized</b> as <b>damage. And here, they disagree with regard to</b> this question: Did the Sages <b>penalize an unintentional</b> offender <b>due to an intentional</b> offender? <b>As</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Meir, who states that the one who caused the damage is liable even if he acted unintentionally, <b>holds</b> that the Sages <b>penalized an unintentional</b> offender <b>due to an intentional</b> offender. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yehuda, who states that one is liable only if he acted intentionally, <b>holds</b> that <b>they did not penalize an unintentional</b> offender <b>due to an intentional</b> offender.",
        "The Gemara comments: <b>But</b> then it is possible to <b>raise a contradiction between</b> this statement <b>of Rabbi Meir and</b> another statement <b>of Rabbi Meir; and</b> it is also possible to <b>raise a contradiction between</b> this statement <b>of Rabbi Yehuda and</b> another statement <b>of Rabbi Yehuda.</b> The other statements are <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Shabbat</i> 2:5): With regard to <b>one who cooks on Shabbat,</b> if he did so <b>unintentionally, he may eat</b> what he cooked. If he acted <b>intentionally, he may not eat</b> what he cooked; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> If he cooked the food <b>unintentionally, he may eat</b> what he cooked, but only <b>at the conclusion of Shabbat.</b> If he cooked it <b>intentionally, he may never eat</b> what he cooked.",
        "The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan HaSandlar says:</b> If he acted <b>unintentionally,</b> what he cooked <b>may be eaten at the conclusion of Shabbat by others, but not by him,</b> as the food is forbidden to him forever. If he cooked the food <b>intentionally,</b> what he cooked <b>may never be eaten, neither by him nor by others.</b> Consequently, there is <b>a contradiction between</b> one statement <b>of Rabbi Meir and</b> the other statement <b>of Rabbi Meir,</b> and there is also <b>a contradiction between</b> one statement <b>of Rabbi Yehuda and</b> the other statement <b>of Rabbi Yehuda.</b>",
        "The Gemara answers: There is no contradiction <b>between</b> one statement <b>of Rabbi Meir and</b> the other statement <b>of Rabbi Meir,</b> because one can draw a distinction between them. <b>When</b> Rabbi Meir <b>penalizes</b> an offender for even an unintentional offense, it is where the offender violated <b>a rabbinic law,</b> e.g., he rendered food impure. But where he violated <b>a Torah law,</b> e.g., he cooked on Shabbat, <b>he does not penalize</b> him. The reason for this distinction is that people treat Torah prohibitions more seriously, and consequently there is no need to impose a fine for unintentional transgression in order to distance people from the transgression.",
        "The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t pouring</b> wine as a libation before an idol prohibited <b>by Torah law, and</b> even so Rabbi Meir <b>penalizes</b> the offender, even if his transgression is unintentional? The Gemara answers: This is an exception to the principle. <b>Due to the severity</b> of the prohibition against <b>idol worship,</b> Rabbi Meir <b>penalizes</b> the offender even if he acts unintentionally.",
        "The Gemara continues: And there is also <b>no contradiction</b> between one statement <b>of Rabbi Yehuda and</b> the other statement <b>of Rabbi Yehuda.

The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t pouring</b> wine as a libation before an idol prohibited <b>by Torah law, and</b> even so Rabbi Yehuda <b>does not penalize</b> the offender if he acted unintentionally? The Gemara answers: The argument raised previously can be reversed: <b>Due to the</b> exceptional <b>severity</b> of the prohibition against <b>idol worship</b> people <b>avoid it</b> on their own, and so there is no need to impose a fine for unintentional transgression in order to distance people from it.",
        "The Gemara comments: <b>But</b> then it is possible to <b>raise a contradiction between</b> one statement of <b>Rabbi Meir and</b> another statement of <b>Rabbi Meir</b> even with respect to matters that are prohibited <b>by Torah law, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Shabbat</i> 2:11): With regard to <b>one who plants</b> a tree <b>on Shabbat,</b> if he does so <b>unintentionally, he may keep</b> the tree. If he acted <b>intentionally, it must be uprooted. And</b> if he planted the tree <b>during the Sabbatical</b> Year, then <b>whether</b> he did so <b>unintentionally or intentionally, it must be uprooted;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b>",
        "<b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> With regard to planting a tree <b>in the Sabbatical</b> Year, if one does so <b>unintentionally, he may keep</b> the tree. If he acted <b>intentionally, it must be uprooted. And</b> if he planted the tree <b>on Shabbat,</b> then <b>whether</b> he did so <b>unintentionally or intentionally, it must be uprooted.</b> Although it is prohibited by Torah law to plant a tree in the Sabbatical Year, Rabbi Meir penalizes the offender and requires that the tree be uprooted, even if he acted unintentionally. This seems to contradict Rabbi Meir’s ruling in the previously mentioned <i>baraita</i>, that one who unintentionally cooked on Shabbat is not penalized.",
        "The Gemara asks: <b>And according to your reasoning,</b> that you raise such a contradiction, <b>raise a contradiction</b> in <b>this</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>itself. Since this</b> prohibition of planting on Shabbat <b>is by Torah law and this</b> prohibition of planting in the Sabbatical Year <b>is by Torah law, what is different about Shabbat and what is different about the Sabbatical</b> Year, that both Sages distinguish between the two <i>halakhot</i>.",
        "<b>Rather, there the reason</b> is <b>as is taught</b> explicitly: <b>Rabbi Meir said: For what</b> reason <b>do I say:</b> If one planted a tree <b>on Shabbat unintentionally, he may keep</b> the tree, but if he did so <b>intentionally, it must be uprooted; but in the Sabbatical</b> Year, <b>whether</b> the tree was planted <b>unintentionally or intentionally, it must be uprooted?</b> It is <b>because Jews count</b> the years of the tree, with regard to the prohibition against eating the fruit of a tree during the first three years after its planting [<i>orla</i>] and with regard to the <i>halakha</i> of fourth-year produce, <b>from the Sabbatical</b> Year. Therefore, if the tree was planted in the Sabbatical Year, people will remember, and they might come to think planting a tree in the Sabbatical Year is permitted. For this reason, Rabbi Meir imposed a fine and required that the tree be uprooted."
      ],
      [
        "<b>But they do not count from Shabbat,</b> as there is no significance to the day of the week on which the tree was planted, and consequently no one remembers that the tree was planted on Shabbat.",
        "<b>Alternatively,</b> the difference between Shabbat and the Sabbatical Year can be explained as follows: <b>Jews are suspected of</b> desecrating <b>the Sabbatical</b> Year, <b>but they are not suspected of</b> desecrating <b>Shabbat.</b> Therefore, Rabbi Meir imposes a penalty for the unintentional desecration of the Sabbatical Year, but he imposes no such penalty for the unintentional desecration of Shabbat.",
        "The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the point of Rabbi Meir adding the second reason, introduced with the term <b>alternatively?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>This is what</b> Rabbi Meir <b>is saying: And if you would say</b> to contest the first reason: Jews <b>also</b> count from <b>Shabbat,</b> and unless the tree is uprooted, people will remember that it was planted on Shabbat, as at <b>times the thirtieth day</b> before Rosh HaShana <b>falls on Shabbat. As, if he planted</b> the tree <b>on that day,</b> the time from when he planted it <b>counts for him as</b> a full <b>year</b> with regard to the prohibition of fruit that grows during the first three years after the tree was planted. <b>And if</b> he did <b>not</b> plant it on that Shabbat, but rather on the next day, the twenty-ninth day before Rosh HaShana, <b>it does not count for him as</b> a full <b>year.</b> In such a case people will remember that the tree was planted on Shabbat, and they might come to think that planting a tree on Shabbat is permitted.",
        "Consequently, Rabbi Meir adds: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> that <b>alternatively,</b> the difference between Shabbat and the Sabbatical Year can be explained as follows: <b>Jews are suspected of</b> desecrating <b>the Sabbatical</b> Year, <b>but they are not suspected of</b> desecrating <b>Shabbat.</b> Therefore, Rabbi Meir imposes a penalty for the unintentional desecration of the Sabbatical Year, but not for the unintentional desecration of Shabbat.",
        "The Gemara continues: And there is also <b>no contradiction</b> between one statement <b>of Rabbi Yehuda</b> with regard to the Sabbatical Year <b>and</b> the other statement <b>of Rabbi Yehuda</b> with regard to Shabbat. This is because <b>in Rabbi Yehuda’s place</b> the prohibition against desecrating <b>the Sabbatical</b> Year <b>was</b> regarded <b>by them</b> as a most <b>serious</b> one, and therefore there was no need to impose a penalty for its unintentional desecration, although it is a Torah law.",
        "The Gemara adduces proof that this is true: It once happened <b>that</b> there was <b>a certain</b> person <b>who said to another</b> to insult him: <b>Convert [<i>dayyar</i>], son of a convert.</b> In anger the second person <b>said to</b> the first in response: At least <b>I don’t eat produce of the Sabbatical</b> Year <b>as you</b> do. This indicates that the Sabbatical Year was treated in that place as a very serious prohibition; therefore, Rabbi Yehuda deemed it unnecessary to impose a penalty for its unintentional desecration.",
        "The Gemara proceeds to discuss another apparent contradiction between rulings of Rabbi Meir with regard to penalties imposed for the unintentional transgression of a rabbinic law: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> what was taught in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Terumot</i> 7:7): If <b>one partook of <i>teruma</i>,</b>which is the property of a priest, and it was ritually <b>impure, he pays</b> restitution with ritually <b>pure, non-sacred</b> produce. <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> if <b>he paid</b> restitution with ritually <b>impure, non-sacred</b> produce? <b>Sumakhos said in the name of Rabbi Meir:</b> If he paid restitution with ritually impure, non-sacred produce <b>unintentionally, his payment is valid.</b> But if he did so <b>intentionally, his payment is not valid. And the Rabbis say:</b> Although <b>both</b> in <b>this</b> case <b>and</b> in <b>that</b> case <b>his payment is valid,</b> the Sages imposed a penalty and said that <b>he returns and pays</b> restitution a second time with ritually <b>pure, non-sacred</b> produce.",
        "<b>And we discussed</b> the following question concerning the opinion of Rabbi Meir: In the case where he paid restitution with ritually impure, non-sacred produce <b>intentionally, why is his payment not valid?</b> On the contrary, <b>blessing should come upon him, as he partook of something that is not fit for</b> the priest to partake of even <b>during the days of his impurity,</b> since it is prohibited for a priest to partake of impure <i>teruma</i>, whether he himself is pure or impure, <b>and he pays</b> restitution <b>to him with something,</b> i.e., impure, non-sacred produce, <b>which is</b> at least <b>fit for him</b> to partake of <b>during the days of his impurity.</b>",
        "<b>And Rava said, and some say it</b> is <b>unattributed:</b> The <i>baraita</i> <b>is incomplete and this is what it is teaching:</b> If <b>one partook of</b> ritually <b>impure <i>teruma</i>, he can pay</b> restitution with <b>anything,</b> even impure, non-sacred produce. If <b>he partook of</b> ritually <b>pure <i>teruma</i>, he pays</b> restitution with ritually <b>pure, non-sacred</b> produce. The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> if <b>he paid</b> restitution for ritually pure <i>teruma</i> with ritually <b>impure, non-sacred</b> produce? There is a tannaitic dispute about this. <b>Sumakhos said in the name of Rabbi Meir:</b> If he paid restitution with ritually impure, non-sacred produce <b>unintentionally, his payment is valid.</b> But if he did so <b>intentionally, his payment is not valid. And the Rabbis say: Both</b> in <b>this</b> case <b>and</b> in <b>that</b> case, <b>his payment is valid,</b> but the Sages imposed a penalty and said that <b>he returns and pays</b> restitution a second time with ritually <b>pure, non-sacred</b> produce.",
        "<b>And Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Ika, said: Here,</b> the practical difference <b>between</b> Rabbi Meir and the Rabbis relates to the question of whether or not the Sages <b>penalized an unintentional</b> offender <b>due to an intentional</b> offender. <b>Rabbi Meir holds</b> that <b>they did not penalize an unintentional</b> offender <b>due to an intentional</b> offender, <b>and the Rabbis say</b> that <b>they penalized him.</b> Consequently, Rabbi Meir does not impose a penalty for an unintentional transgression of a rabbinic law, as by Torah law one can pay restitution to a priest with anything if he partakes of <i>teruma</i>. This contradicts what was stated previously, that in the case of a violation of rabbinic law, Rabbi Meir imposes a penalty even for an unintentional offense.",
        "The Gemara answers: <b>How can</b> these cases <b>be compared? There, the man intends to pay; should we arise and penalize him?</b> It is specifically with regard to this case that Rabbi Meir holds that no penalty is imposed, as his mistake was made in the course of performing a laudatory action. By contrast, in cases where one rendered another’s produce impure and the like, there is a penalty, as the mistake was made while performing an action he should not have been performing.",
        "The Gemara tries to bring proof concerning the previously stated opinion of Rabbi Meir that a penalty is imposed in a case of an unintentional transgression of a rabbinical law: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> what was taught in a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>blood</b> of an offering <b>that became impure and</b> a priest <b>sprinkled it</b> on the altar, if he did so <b>unintentionally,</b> the offering is <b>accepted</b> and achieves atonement for the owner of the offering. If he sprinkled the blood <b>intentionally,</b> the offering <b>is not accepted.</b> In any event, the <i>tanna</i> of this <i>baraita</i> did not penalize the unintentional offender due to an intentional offender, and this sprinkling of blood is prohibited by rabbinic law.",
        "The Gemara answers: <b>Rabbi Meir</b> could have <b>said to you: How can</b> these cases <b>be compared? There, the person intends to</b> do a mitzva and <b>atone; should we arise and penalize him?</b> Here too, the mistake was made while performing a laudatory act. In such a case, even Rabbi Meir agrees that an unintentional offender is not penalized due to an intentional offender.",
        "The Gemara attempts to adduce further proof: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> what was taught in a mishna (<i>Terumot</i> 2:3): With regard to <b>one who tithes</b> produce <b>on Shabbat,</b> which is prohibited by rabbinic law because it appears as though he were repairing an article that requires repair, if he did this <b>unintentionally, he may consume</b> the produce, as it has been tithed and rendered fit for consumption. But if he did this <b>intentionally, he may not consume</b> it. Apparently, the Sages did not penalize the unintentional offender due to an intentional offender, although tithing produce on Shabbat is prohibited by rabbinic law. The Gemara answers: <b>How can</b> these cases <b>be compared? There, the man intends to</b> do a worthy deed and <b>repair</b> the produce by tithing it; <b>should we arise and penalize him?</b> As above, Rabbi Meir would agree that in such a case the unintentional offender is not penalized.",
        "The Gemara brings yet another proof: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> what was taught in that same mishna (<i>Terumot</i> 2:3): With regard to <b>one who immerses utensils</b> in a ritual bath <b>on Shabbat,</b> which is also prohibited by the Sages because it appears as if he were repairing an article that requires repair, if he immerses them <b>unintentionally, he may use them.</b> But if he immerses them <b>intentionally, he may not use them.</b> Here too the Sages did not penalize the unintentional offender due to an intentional offender. The Gemara answers as before: <b>How can</b> these cases <b>be compared? There, the man intends to</b> do a praiseworthy act and <b>purify the utensils; should we arise and penalize him?</b> The same distinction stated previously applies in this mishna as well.",
        "The Gemara discusses the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda: <b>And they raised a contradiction between</b> one statement <b>of Rabbi Yehuda and</b> another statement <b>of Rabbi Yehuda</b> with regard to matters that are prohibited only <b>by rabbinic law. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>:"

        "If there are nuts from Perekh that are <i>orla</i>, and <b>they fell</b> into other nuts and became intermingled with them, the entire mixture is forbidden, even if the nuts that are <i>orla</i> are few in number.

        "The Gemara discusses the previous <i>baraita</i>: <b>And they raised a contradiction between</b> one statement <b>of Rabbi Yosei and</b> another statement <b>of Rabbi Yosei, as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Orla</i> 1:6): If <b>a sapling</b> that has the status <b>of <i>orla</i> or</b> a grapevine sapling has the status <b>of diverse kinds in a vineyard,</b> e.g., one vine in a vineyard had grain planted near it and become prohibited, and the grain was then uprooted, <b>became intermingled with other</b> saplings, and one does not know which is the forbidden sapling, <b>he may not gather</b> the produce of any of the saplings. <b>And if he gathered</b> the produce, the forbidden produce <b>is nullified</b> if its ratio in the mixture is not more than <b>one</b> part forbidden produce <b>in two hundred</b> parts permitted produce, <b>provided that he did not intend to gather</b> the produce in order that the forbidden produce will become nullified.",
        "<b>Rabbi Yosei says: Even if he intentionally gathered</b> the produce in order that the forbidden produce would become nullified, the forbidden produce <b>is nullified</b> if its ratio in the mixture is not more than <b>one</b> part forbidden produce <b>in two hundred</b> parts permitted produce.

If he did so, it is uncommon, and the Sages did not impose a penalty in an uncommon case. <b>And similarly, when Ravin came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, he said that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> There is <b>a presumption</b> that <b>a person does not render his vineyard forbidden for the sake of one sapling,</b> and therefore the Sages did not impose a penalty."

      "§ <b>The Sages taught</b> (<i>Tosefta</i> 7:6): If a husband said to his wife: <b>This is your bill of divorce on the condition that you will serve</b> my <b>father</b> for <b>two years, or</b> he said: This is your bill of divorce <b>on the condition that you will nurse my son</b> for <b>two years, even if the condition was not fulfilled it is</b> a valid <b>bill of divorce because he did not say to her: If you will serve</b> my father then this will be a valid bill of divorce, and <b>if you will not serve</b> him it will not be a valid bill of divorce, or: <b>If you will nurse</b> my son then this will be a valid bill of divorce, <b>and if you will not nurse</b> him it will not be a valid bill of divorce. And if he did not state his condition as a compound condition, stipulating both positive and negative outcomes, the condition is void and the bill of divorce is valid. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b>",
      "<b>And the Rabbis say:</b> The condition is valid even if it the husband does not stipulate both positive and negative outcomes. Consequently, if <b>the condition was fulfilled this is</b> a valid <b>bill of divorce, and if</b> it was <b>not</b> fulfilled <b>this is not</b> a valid <b>bill of divorce. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: You do not have a condition in the Bible that is not compounded.</b>",
      "To which side of the dispute is Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel’s statement referring? <b>There are</b> those <b>who say: He is speaking to Rabbi Meir. And there are</b> those <b>who say: He is speaking to the Rabbis.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> that this means <b>he is speaking to Rabbi Meir and this is what he is saying to him: You do not have a condition in the Bible that is not compounded,</b> and therefore the compound conditions mentioned in the Torah <b>have</b> the status of <b>two verses that come as one,</b> i.e., to teach the same matter. <b>And any two verses that come as one do not teach</b> about other cases. Consequently, one cannot derive from them that every condition must be compounded.",
      "<b>There are</b> those <b>who say: He is saying</b> this <b>to the Rabbis, and this is what he is saying to them: There is no condition in the Bible that is not compounded, and we learn from</b> the conditions written in the Bible that a condition is not valid unless it is compounded.",
      "<b>And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> based on what was taught in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 7:6): If a husband said to his wife: <b>This is your bill of divorce on the condition that you will serve</b> my <b>father</b> for <b>two years,</b> or he said to her: This is your bill of divorce <b>on the condition that you will nurse my son</b> for <b>two years,</b> and <b>the father died or the son died,</b> then <b>it is not</b> a valid <b>bill of divorce,</b> as its condition was not fulfilled. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b>",
      "<b>And the Rabbis say: Even though the condition was not fulfilled it is</b> a valid <b>bill of divorce,</b> as <b>she could have said to him: Give me your father and I will serve him,</b> or: <b>Give me your son and I will nurse him.</b>",
      "It is <b>difficult</b> to reconcile one statement <b>of Rabbi Meir with</b> the other statement made by <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> for the second <i>baraita</i> indicates that the husband’s condition does not need to be compounded. And it is <b>difficult</b> to reconcile one statement <b>of the Rabbis with</b> the other statement of <b>the Rabbis,</b> for in the second <i>baraita</i> they say that if the condition was fulfilled it is a valid bill of divorce, and if it was not fulfilled it is not a valid bill of divorce.",
      "The Gemara answers: It is <b>not difficult</b> to reconcile one statement <b>of Rabbi Meir with</b> the other statement <b>of Rabbi Meir,</b> as <b>there,</b> in the case where the bill of divorce is valid, it is referring to <b>when he did not compound his condition. Here,</b> where the bill of divorce is valid, it is referring to <b>when he did compound his condition,</b> but the <i>tanna</i> of the <i>baraita</i> did not mention that fact explicitly.",
      "<b>And</b> it is <b>not difficult</b> to reconcile one statement of <b>the Rabbis with</b> the other statement <b>of the Rabbis,</b> because <b>whose</b> is the opinion mentioned <b>here</b> anonymously as <b>the Rabbis? It is</b> the opinion of <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, who says:</b> If there is <b>any hindrance</b> to fulfilling the condition <b>that is not from her, it is</b> a valid <b>bill of divorce.</b>"
