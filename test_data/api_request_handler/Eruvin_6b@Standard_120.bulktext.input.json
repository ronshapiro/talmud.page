        "<b>And if you say</b> that <b>damage that is not evident is categorized</b> as <b>damage,</b> then <b>this</b> man <b>is a robber,</b> and <b>he should be required to pay full compensation</b> for the damage he caused. The Gemara concludes: This is <b>a conclusive refutation,</b> and the opinion of Ḥizkiyya is rejected.",
        "The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say</b> that this amoraic dispute is <b>parallel to</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>,</b> as it was taught in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>one who renders</b> another’s food ritually <b>impure, or one who mixes</b> <i>teruma</i> with another’s non-sacred produce, <b>or one who pours</b> another’s wine as a libation before an idol, <b>whether</b> he did so <b>unintentionally or intentionally,</b> he is <b>liable</b> to pay for the damage he caused; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.

        "The Gemara suggests: <b>What, is it not</b> that <b>they disagree about this</b> very issue? <b>As</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Meir, <b>holds</b> that <b>damage that is not evident is</b> nevertheless <b>categorized</b> as <b>damage.</b> Consequently, one is liable to pay even if he caused the damage unintentionally. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yehuda, <b>holds</b> that such damage <b>is not categorized</b> as <b>damage,</b> and consequently one is liable to pay only if he caused the damage intentionally, as this is a rabbinically instituted fine.",
        "<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said</b> that it is possible to say that <b>everyone,</b> including Rabbi Meir, <b>agrees that damage that is not evident is not categorized</b> as <b>damage.

        "The Gemara comments: <b>But</b> then it is possible to <b>raise a contradiction between</b> this statement <b>of Rabbi Meir and</b> another statement <b>of Rabbi Meir; and</b> it is also possible to <b>raise a contradiction between</b> this statement <b>of Rabbi Yehuda and</b> another statement <b>of Rabbi Yehuda.</b> The other statements are <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Shabbat</i> 2:5): With regard to <b>one who cooks on Shabbat,</b> if he did so <b>unintentionally, he may eat</b> what he cooked.

If he cooked the food <b>intentionally,</b> what he cooked <b>may never be eaten, neither by him nor by others.</b> Consequently, there is <b>a contradiction between</b> one statement <b>of Rabbi Meir and</b> the other statement <b>of Rabbi Meir,</b> and there is also <b>a contradiction between</b> one statement <b>of Rabbi Yehuda and</b> the other statement <b>of Rabbi Yehuda.</b>",
        "The Gemara answers: There is no contradiction <b>between</b> one statement <b>of Rabbi Meir and</b> the other statement <b>of Rabbi Meir,</b> because one can draw a distinction between them. <b>When</b> Rabbi Meir <b>penalizes</b> an offender for even an unintentional offense, it is where the offender violated <b>a rabbinic law,</b> e.g., he rendered food impure. But where he violated <b>a Torah law,</b> e.g., he cooked on Shabbat, <b>he does not penalize</b> him.

        "The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t pouring</b> wine as a libation before an idol prohibited <b>by Torah law, and</b> even so Rabbi Meir <b>penalizes</b> the offender, even if his transgression is unintentional?

        "The Gemara continues: And there is also <b>no contradiction</b> between one statement <b>of Rabbi Yehuda and</b> the other statement <b>of Rabbi Yehuda.

The Gemara answers: The argument raised previously can be reversed: <b>Due to the</b> exceptional <b>severity</b> of the prohibition against <b>idol worship</b> people <b>avoid it</b> on their own, and so there is no need to impose a fine for unintentional transgression in order to distance people from it.",
        "The Gemara comments: <b>But</b> then it is possible to <b>raise a contradiction between</b> one statement of <b>Rabbi Meir and</b> another statement of <b>Rabbi Meir</b> even with respect to matters that are prohibited <b>by Torah law, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Shabbat</i> 2:11): With regard to <b>one who plants</b> a tree <b>on Shabbat,</b> if he does so <b>unintentionally, he may keep</b> the tree. If he acted <b>intentionally, it must be uprooted. And</b> if he planted the tree <b>during the Sabbatical</b> Year, then <b>whether</b> he did so <b>unintentionally or intentionally, it must be uprooted;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b>",
        "<b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> With regard to planting a tree <b>in the Sabbatical</b> Year, if one does so <b>unintentionally, he may keep</b> the tree. If he acted <b>intentionally, it must be uprooted. And</b> if he planted the tree <b>on Shabbat,</b> then <b>whether</b> he did so <b>unintentionally or intentionally, it must be uprooted.</b> Although it is prohibited by Torah law to plant a tree in the Sabbatical Year, Rabbi Meir penalizes the offender and requires that the tree be uprooted, even if he acted unintentionally. This seems to contradict Rabbi Meir’s ruling in the previously mentioned <i>baraita</i>, that one who unintentionally cooked on Shabbat is not penalized.",
        "The Gemara asks: <b>And according to your reasoning,</b> that you raise such a contradiction, <b>raise a contradiction</b> in <b>this</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>itself. Since this</b> prohibition of planting on Shabbat <b>is by Torah law and this</b> prohibition of planting in the Sabbatical Year <b>is by Torah law, what is different about Shabbat and what is different about the Sabbatical</b> Year, that both Sages distinguish between the two <i>halakhot</i>.",
        "<b>Rather, there the reason</b> is <b>as is taught</b> explicitly: <b>Rabbi Meir said: For what</b> reason <b>do I say:</b> If one planted a tree <b>on Shabbat unintentionally, he may keep</b> the tree, but if he did so <b>intentionally, it must be uprooted; but in the Sabbatical</b> Year, <b>whether</b> the tree was planted <b>unintentionally or intentionally, it must be uprooted?</b> It is <b>because Jews count</b> the years of the tree, with regard to the prohibition against eating the fruit of a tree during the first three years after its planting [<i>orla</i>] and with regard to the <i>halakha</i> of fourth-year produce, <b>from the Sabbatical</b> Year. Therefore, if the tree was planted in the Sabbatical Year, people will remember, and they might come to think planting a tree in the Sabbatical Year is permitted. For this reason, Rabbi Meir imposed a fine and required that the tree be uprooted."
      ],
      [
        "<b>But they do not count from Shabbat,</b> as there is no significance to the day of the week on which the tree was planted, and consequently no one remembers that the tree was planted on Shabbat.",
        "<b>Alternatively,</b> the difference between Shabbat and the Sabbatical Year can be explained as follows: <b>Jews are suspected of</b> desecrating <b>the Sabbatical</b> Year, <b>but they are not suspected of</b> desecrating <b>Shabbat.</b> Therefore, Rabbi Meir imposes a penalty for the unintentional desecration of the Sabbatical Year, but he imposes no such penalty for the unintentional desecration of Shabbat.",
        "The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the point of Rabbi Meir adding the second reason, introduced with the term <b>alternatively?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>This is what</b> Rabbi Meir <b>is saying: And if you would say</b> to contest the first reason: Jews <b>also</b> count from <b>Shabbat,</b> and unless the tree is uprooted, people will remember that it was planted on Shabbat, as at <b>times the thirtieth day</b> before Rosh HaShana <b>falls on Shabbat. As, if he planted</b> the tree <b>on that day,</b> the time from when he planted it <b>counts for him as</b> a full <b>year</b> with regard to the prohibition of fruit that grows during the first three years after the tree was planted. <b>And if</b> he did <b>not</b> plant it on that Shabbat, but rather on the next day, the twenty-ninth day before Rosh HaShana, <b>it does not count for him as</b> a full <b>year.</b> In such a case people will remember that the tree was planted on Shabbat, and they might come to think that planting a tree on Shabbat is permitted.",
        "Consequently, Rabbi Meir adds: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> that <b>alternatively,</b> the difference between Shabbat and the Sabbatical Year can be explained as follows: <b>Jews are suspected of</b> desecrating <b>the Sabbatical</b> Year, <b>but they are not suspected of</b> desecrating <b>Shabbat.</b> Therefore, Rabbi Meir imposes a penalty for the unintentional desecration of the Sabbatical Year, but not for the unintentional desecration of Shabbat.",
        "The Gemara continues: And there is also <b>no contradiction</b> between one statement <b>of Rabbi Yehuda</b> with regard to the Sabbatical Year <b>and</b> the other statement <b>of Rabbi Yehuda</b> with regard to Shabbat. This is because <b>in Rabbi Yehuda’s place</b> the prohibition against desecrating <b>the Sabbatical</b> Year <b>was</b> regarded <b>by them</b> as a most <b>serious</b> one, and therefore there was no need to impose a penalty for its unintentional desecration, although it is a Torah law.",
        "The Gemara adduces proof that this is true: It once happened <b>that</b> there was <b>a certain</b> person <b>who said to another</b> to insult him: <b>Convert [<i>dayyar</i>], son of a convert.</b> In anger the second person <b>said to</b> the first in response: At least <b>I don’t eat produce of the Sabbatical</b> Year <b>as you</b> do. This indicates that the Sabbatical Year was treated in that place as a very serious prohibition; therefore, Rabbi Yehuda deemed it unnecessary to impose a penalty for its unintentional desecration.",
        "The Gemara proceeds to discuss another apparent contradiction between rulings of Rabbi Meir with regard to penalties imposed for the unintentional transgression of a rabbinic law: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> what was taught in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Terumot</i> 7:7): If <b>one partook of <i>teruma</i>,</b>which is the property of a priest, and it was ritually <b>impure, he pays</b> restitution with ritually <b>pure, non-sacred</b> produce. <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> if <b>he paid</b> restitution with ritually <b>impure, non-sacred</b> produce? <b>Sumakhos said in the name of Rabbi Meir:</b> If he paid restitution with ritually impure, non-sacred produce <b>unintentionally, his payment is valid.</b> But if he did so <b>intentionally, his payment is not valid. And the Rabbis say:</b> Although <b>both</b> in <b>this</b> case <b>and</b> in <b>that</b> case <b>his payment is valid,</b> the Sages imposed a penalty and said that <b>he returns and pays</b> restitution a second time with ritually <b>pure, non-sacred</b> produce.",
        "<b>And we discussed</b> the following question concerning the opinion of Rabbi Meir: In the case where he paid restitution with ritually impure, non-sacred produce <b>intentionally, why is his payment not valid?</b> On the contrary, <b>blessing should come upon him, as he partook of something that is not fit for</b> the priest to partake of even <b>during the days of his impurity,</b> since it is prohibited for a priest to partake of impure <i>teruma</i>, whether he himself is pure or impure, <b>and he pays</b> restitution <b>to him with something,</b> i.e., impure, non-sacred produce, <b>which is</b> at least <b>fit for him</b> to partake of <b>during the days of his impurity.</b>",
        "<b>And Rava said, and some say it</b> is <b>unattributed:</b> The <i>baraita</i> <b>is incomplete and this is what it is teaching:</b> If <b>one partook of</b> ritually <b>impure <i>teruma</i>, he can pay</b> restitution with <b>anything,</b> even impure, non-sacred produce. If <b>he partook of</b> ritually <b>pure <i>teruma</i>, he pays</b> restitution with ritually <b>pure, non-sacred</b> produce. The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> if <b>he paid</b> restitution for ritually pure <i>teruma</i> with ritually <b>impure, non-sacred</b> produce? There is a tannaitic dispute about this. <b>Sumakhos said in the name of Rabbi Meir:</b> If he paid restitution with ritually impure, non-sacred produce <b>unintentionally, his payment is valid.</b> But if he did so <b>intentionally, his payment is not valid. And the Rabbis say: Both</b> in <b>this</b> case <b>and</b> in <b>that</b> case, <b>his payment is valid,</b> but the Sages imposed a penalty and said that <b>he returns and pays</b> restitution a second time with ritually <b>pure, non-sacred</b> produce.",
        "<b>And Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Ika, said: Here,</b> the practical difference <b>between</b> Rabbi Meir and the Rabbis relates to the question of whether or not the Sages <b>penalized an unintentional</b> offender <b>due to an intentional</b> offender. <b>Rabbi Meir holds</b> that <b>they did not penalize an unintentional</b> offender <b>due to an intentional</b> offender, <b>and the Rabbis say</b> that <b>they penalized him.</b> Consequently, Rabbi Meir does not impose a penalty for an unintentional transgression of a rabbinic law, as by Torah law one can pay restitution to a priest with anything if he partakes of <i>teruma</i>. This contradicts what was stated previously, that in the case of a violation of rabbinic law, Rabbi Meir imposes a penalty even for an unintentional offense.",
        "The Gemara answers: <b>How can</b> these cases <b>be compared? There, the man intends to pay; should we arise and penalize him?</b> It is specifically with regard to this case that Rabbi Meir holds that no penalty is imposed, as his mistake was made in the course of performing a laudatory action. By contrast, in cases where one rendered another’s produce impure and the like, there is a penalty, as the mistake was made while performing an action he should not have been performing.",
        "The Gemara tries to bring proof concerning the previously stated opinion of Rabbi Meir that a penalty is imposed in a case of an unintentional transgression of a rabbinical law: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> what was taught in a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>blood</b> of an offering <b>that became impure and</b> a priest <b>sprinkled it</b> on the altar, if he did so <b>unintentionally,</b> the offering is <b>accepted</b> and achieves atonement for the owner of the offering. If he sprinkled the blood <b>intentionally,</b> the offering <b>is not accepted.</b> In any event, the <i>tanna</i> of this <i>baraita</i> did not penalize the unintentional offender due to an intentional offender, and this sprinkling of blood is prohibited by rabbinic law.",
        "The Gemara answers: <b>Rabbi Meir</b> could have <b>said to you: How can</b> these cases <b>be compared? There, the person intends to</b> do a mitzva and <b>atone; should we arise and penalize him?</b> Here too, the mistake was made while performing a laudatory act. In such a case, even Rabbi Meir agrees that an unintentional offender is not penalized due to an intentional offender.",
        "The Gemara attempts to adduce further proof: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> what was taught in a mishna (<i>Terumot</i> 2:3): With regard to <b>one who tithes</b> produce <b>on Shabbat,</b> which is prohibited by rabbinic law because it appears as though he were repairing an article that requires repair, if he did this <b>unintentionally, he may consume</b> the produce, as it has been tithed and rendered fit for consumption. But if he did this <b>intentionally, he may not consume</b> it. Apparently, the Sages did not penalize the unintentional offender due to an intentional offender, although tithing produce on Shabbat is prohibited by rabbinic law. The Gemara answers: <b>How can</b> these cases <b>be compared? There, the man intends to</b> do a worthy deed and <b>repair</b> the produce by tithing it; <b>should we arise and penalize him?</b> As above, Rabbi Meir would agree that in such a case the unintentional offender is not penalized.",
        "The Gemara brings yet another proof: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> what was taught in that same mishna (<i>Terumot</i> 2:3): With regard to <b>one who immerses utensils</b> in a ritual bath <b>on Shabbat,</b> which is also prohibited by the Sages because it appears as if he were repairing an article that requires repair, if he immerses them <b>unintentionally, he may use them.</b> But if he immerses them <b>intentionally, he may not use them.</b> Here too the Sages did not penalize the unintentional offender due to an intentional offender. The Gemara answers as before: <b>How can</b> these cases <b>be compared? There, the man intends to</b> do a praiseworthy act and <b>purify the utensils; should we arise and penalize him?</b> The same distinction stated previously applies in this mishna as well.",
        "The Gemara discusses the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda: <b>And they raised a contradiction between</b> one statement <b>of Rabbi Yehuda and</b> another statement <b>of Rabbi Yehuda</b> with regard to matters that are prohibited only <b>by rabbinic law. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>:"

        "The Gemara discusses the previous <i>baraita</i>: <b>And they raised a contradiction between</b> one statement <b>of Rabbi Yosei and</b> another statement <b>of Rabbi Yosei, as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Orla</i> 1:6): If <b>a sapling</b> that has the status <b>of <i>orla</i> or</b> a grapevine sapling has the status <b>of diverse kinds in a vineyard,</b> e.g., one vine in a vineyard had grain planted near it and become prohibited, and the grain was then uprooted, <b>became intermingled with other</b> saplings, and one does not know which is the forbidden sapling, <b>he may not gather</b> the produce of any of the saplings. <b>And if he gathered</b> the produce, the forbidden produce <b>is nullified</b> if its ratio in the mixture is not more than <b>one</b> part forbidden produce <b>in two hundred</b> parts permitted produce, <b>provided that he did not intend to gather</b> the produce in order that the forbidden produce will become nullified.",
        "<b>Rabbi Yosei says: Even if he intentionally gathered</b> the produce in order that the forbidden produce would become nullified, the forbidden produce <b>is nullified</b> if its ratio in the mixture is not more than <b>one</b> part forbidden produce <b>in two hundred</b> parts permitted produce.

        "The Gemara answers: <b>Wasn’t it</b> already <b>stated with regard to</b> that mishna in explanation of Rabbi Yosei’s opinion that <b>Rava says:</b> There is <b>a presumption</b> that <b>a person does not render his entire vineyard forbidden for the sake of one sapling.</b> Therefore, it can be assumed that one does not intentionally plant a sapling that has the status of <i>orla</i> or of diverse kinds in a vineyard among other saplings without properly marking it. If he did so, it is uncommon, and the Sages did not impose a penalty in an uncommon case. <b>And similarly, when Ravin came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, he said that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> There is <b>a presumption</b> that <b>a person does not render his vineyard forbidden for the sake of one sapling,</b> and therefore the Sages did not impose a penalty."

But didn’t we learn</b> that <b>they</b> said the <b>opposite? As we learned</b> in a mishna: In a case where there were <b>donkey drivers who entered a city, and one of them said: My</b> produce <b>is new</b> from this year’s crop, and it is not yet completely dry and therefore of lower quality, <b>and the</b> produce <b>of my counterpart is old</b> and dry and therefore more durable; or if he said: <b>My</b> produce <b>is not tithed and the</b> produce <b>of my counterpart is tithed, he is not deemed credible.</b> Presumably, there is collusion between the two merchants. In this city, one denigrates the quality of his own produce, enhancing his credibility, while praising the quality of the produce of his counterpart; and his counterpart says the same in the next city that they enter. <b>And Rabbi Yehuda says: He is deemed credible,</b> as apparently he is not concerned for collusion between the merchants.",

The ordinance of the Sages classifying produce purchased from an <i>am ha’aretz</i> as doubtfully tithed produce and requiring its tithing is based on a far-fetched concern. Therefore, testimony of any sort is sufficient to permit its consumption. However, as a rule, Rabbi Yehuda is concerned about collusion.",

        "The Gemara asks: <b>And where</b> is the solution <b>of Rabbi Ḥama bar Ukva stated?</b> It is stated <b>concerning that which we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Teharot</i> 7:1): In the case of <b>a potter who</b> fashioned his vessels in ritual purity, and <b>abandoned his pots, and descended to drink water from the river,</b> there is concern that in his absence ritually impure people came into contact with his pots. <b>The inner</b> pots <b>are pure, and the outer</b> pots <b>are impure.</b>",

They do not pass close to the inner pots and will not touch the pots to examine them, because they are not for sale.",
        "The Gemara proceeds to cite an additional resolution to the contradiction between the opinions of Rabbi Yehuda and the Rabbis, with regard to collusion in terms of the presumptive status of priests and in terms of produce merchants. <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that the dispute between <b>Rabbi Yehuda and the Rabbis</b> in the matter of presumptive priestly status is unrelated to collusion.

        "§ The mishna mentions among a wife’s obligations that she <b>nurses her child.</b> The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say that the mishna is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Beit Shammai, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If a woman <b>took a vow not to nurse her child, Beit Shammai say:</b> Since she vowed, <b>she</b> must <b>remove</b> her <b>nipple from his mouth</b> and not nurse him. <b>Beit Hillel say:</b> Her husband <b>can compel her, and she</b> must <b>nurse</b> the child even against her will. However, if <b>she was divorced</b> and therefore had no further obligations to her husband, <b>he cannot compel her.</b> Nevertheless, <b>if</b> the baby <b>recognized her,</b> then even after the divorce, her husband may <b>pay her a salary</b> as a wet nurse <b>and compel her to nurse due to</b> the <b>danger</b> that the child will starve if he refuses to nurse from another woman. This <i>baraita</i> indicates that according to Beit Shammai a woman has no obligation to nurse her child. If she had a prior obligation to her husband to nurse the child, the vow would not take effect.",
        "The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>Even</b> if <b>you say</b> that the mishna is also in accordance with the opinion of <b>Beit Shammai, here we are dealing with</b> a case <b>where she made</b> this <b>vow and</b> her husband <b>ratified</b> it <b>for her</b> by refraining from nullifying it. <b>Beit Shammai maintain</b> that in that case it is considered as if <b>he had placed his finger between her teeth,</b> i.e., he caused the vow to be in effect, meaning that in that case the responsibility lies with him. Since he declined the opportunity to nullify the vow, her obligation to nurse is canceled. <b>Beit Hillel maintain</b> that in that case <b>she put her finger between her</b> own <b>teeth,</b> i.e., she caused the vow to remain in effect. Consequently, although he ratified her vow, the responsibility rests on her, and for this reason her obligation is not annulled.",
        "The Gemara asks: If so, that the dispute is about who is responsible when a woman vows and her husband ratifies the vow, and it is not specifically about her obligation to nurse her child, then <b>let them dispute about a marriage contract in general,</b> with regard to whether or not a woman is entitled to payment for her marriage contract if she vows to prohibit her husband from deriving benefit from her. <b>And furthermore, it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>that Beit Shammai</b> explicitly <b>say</b> with regard to all women, not specifically in the context of vows: <b>She does not</b> need to <b>nurse</b> if she does not want to. <b>Rather, it is clear</b> that <b>the mishna is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Beit Shammai.</b>",

        "<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said:</b> Shmuel’s proof is from the <i>halakha</i> of <b>a bride in her father’s house, but with regard to</b> the money used for <b>betrothal,</b> not for the marriage contract. The father must bring proof in order to retain the betrothal money.",
        "Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak explains: <b>And do not say</b> that this is only <b>according to the one who says</b> in general that <b>betrothal</b> money <b>was not given</b> with the understanding that it is <b>to be lost,</b> that is, the money was handed over only for the purpose of betrothal and it must be returned if the betrothal is canceled. <b>Rather,</b> say that this is <b>even according to the one who says</b> that in the case of <b>betrothal</b> money that <b>was given to be lost, this applies only</b> to <b>a betrothal</b> whose status is <b>certain.</b> According to this opinion, if a husband later divorces his wife or dies she does not have to restore the betrothal money. <b>But</b> with regard to a <b>mistaken betrothal, if</b> the father <b>brings proof</b> then <b>yes,</b> he may keep the money; <b>if</b> he does <b>not</b> bring proof he may <b>not</b> retain ownership of the betrothal money. This supports Shmuel’s opinion that in an uncertain case the one in possession of the money must bring proof in order to retain his ownership.",
        "The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to Shmuel’s opinion with regard to presumptions from a <i>baraita</i> about a different issue: In a case of <b>a needle that is found in the thick wall of</b> a slaughtered animal’s <b>second stomach,</b> if it has pierced the stomach <b>from</b> only <b>one side,</b> the animal is <b>kosher.</b> If the stomach is pierced <b>from both sides,</b> meaning that the needle pierced a hole completely through the wall of the stomach, it has the status of <b>an animal with a condition that will cause it to die within twelve months</b> [<b><i>tereifa</i></b>], and one is consequently prohibited to eat from it. Furthermore, if <b>a drop of</b> congealed <b>blood is found on top of</b> the needle, <b>it is certain that</b> the perforation was created <b>before</b> the <b>slaughtering</b> of the animal, and it is therefore a <i>tereifa</i>. If <b>no drop of blood is found on it, it is certain that it</b> occurred <b>after</b> the <b>slaughtering,</b> which means the animal is kosher.",
        "If <b>a scab appeared over the wound</b> on that spot, <b>it is certain that</b> the incident happened <b>three days before</b> the <b>slaughtering.</b> The significance of this fact is that if the animal was sold to a butcher after this point in time, the butcher can claim that the transaction was performed in error, as he did not intend to purchase a <i>tereifa</i> animal. If <b>a scab did not appear over the wound,</b> and the seller claims that the animal was injured while in the possession of the butcher who purchased the animal, while the butcher claims that it was wounded when he bought it, <b>the burden of proof rests upon the claimant. And</b> therefore, <b>if</b> the <b>butcher had</b> already <b>given the money, he needs to bring proof and</b> then he can <b>take</b> his money back from the seller.",
        "The Gemara returns to Shmuel’s opinion: <b>But why</b> should this be the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Let</b> the <b>owner of the animal,</b> i.e., the seller, <b>bring proof and establish</b> the validity of the sale, just as the owner of the donkey must provide proof in order to maintain possession of the cow. Why is the burden of proof upon the butcher?",
        "The Gemara answers: This <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case <b>where the butcher had not</b> yet <b>given</b> the <b>money,</b> but was going to pay at a later time. Therefore, the seller is the one claiming money from the butcher, and he must offer proof in order for the transaction to be upheld. The Gemara poses a question: <b>Why</b> was it stated <b>without qualification?</b> The wording of the <i>baraita</i> implies that either side must bring proof. This <i>baraita</i> appears to refute the opinion of Shmuel.",
        "<b>Rather, when Rami bar Yeḥezkel came, he said: Pay no attention to those rules formulated by my brother Yehuda in the name of Shmuel.</b> In actuality, <b>this is</b> what <b>Shmuel said:</b> In <b>whosesoever’s domain the uncertainty came into being, the burden of proof rests upon him.</b> In the case of the exchange of the cow for the donkey, it is the owner of the cow who must provide proof. <b>And the <i>tanna</i></b> of the mishna also <b>taught</b> along similar lines with regard to <b>a bride.</b> If the bride was in her father’s domain he must provide proof; if she was living with her husband the burden of proof is upon him.",
