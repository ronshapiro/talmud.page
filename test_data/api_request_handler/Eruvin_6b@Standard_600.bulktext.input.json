        "§ Apropos the mishna’s comments concerning the details of the relationship between Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel, the Gemara discusses the issue of disputes in general. <b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>there,</b> in tractate <i>Megilla</i> (2a): <b>The Megilla,</b> the Scroll of Esther, <b>is read on the eleventh</b> of Adar, <b>on the twelfth, on the thirteenth, on the fourteenth, or on the fifteenth,</b> in cities surrounded by a wall, <b>no earlier and no later</b> than this. The obligation to read the Megilla on the fourteenth or fifteenth of Adar is stated in the Megilla itself, while the additional days were instituted by the Sages to allow residents of villages, who would come to the cities on Mondays and Thursdays and supply water and rations to the residents of the cities, to hear the reading of the Megilla at that opportunity.",
        "<b>Reish Lakish said to Rabbi Yoḥanan: I</b> should <b>read here</b> the verse: <b>“You shall not cut yourselves [<i>titgodedu</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 14:1), which is interpreted as meaning: <b>Do not become numerous factions [<i>agudot</i>].</b> In other words, the Jewish people should be united, rather than divided into disparate groups that act in different ways. Before analyzing this issue, the Gemara asks: <b>This</b> verse: <b>“You shall not cut yourselves,” is required for the matter itself, as the Merciful One is saying: Do not cut yourselves over the dead.</b> How is the <i>halakha</i> concerning factions derived from this apparently straightforward verse?",
        "The Gemara answers: <b>If so,</b> that the verse comes to teach only about the practices of mourning, <b>let the verse state</b> only: <b>You shall not cut. What</b> is the meaning of: <b>“You shall not cut yourselves”? Learn from this</b> that <b>it comes for this</b> purpose as well, to teach the prohibition against splitting into factions. The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> in that case, one can <b>say</b> that <b>the entire</b> verse <b>comes</b> for <b>this</b> purpose and does not refer to cutting for the dead at all. The Gemara answers: <b>If so, let the verse state: <i>Lo tagodu</i>,</b> rather than <i>lo titgodedu</i>, both of which mean: <b>You shall not cut. What</b> is the meaning of: <b>“<i>Lo titgodedu</i>”? Conclude two</b> conclusions <b>from it:</b> Both the simple prohibition against making cuts for the dead and the matter of dividing into factions.",
        "After this incidental discussion, the Gemara returns to the basic question raised by Reish Lakish: Why doesn’t the reading of the Scroll of Esther in different places at different times violate the prohibition against breaking into factions? Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to him:</b> Have <b>you not taught until now:</b> In <b>a place where</b> the people were <b>accustomed to perform labor on Passover eve until midday, one may do</b> so on that day; in <b>a place where</b> the people were <b>accustomed not to perform</b> labor, <b>one may not do</b> so? This shows that different places can have different customs without violating the prohibition against dividing into factions.",
        "Reish Lakish <b>said to</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan: <b>I speak to you</b> of <b>a prohibition,</b> as residents of villages are prohibited from reading the Megilla with a blessing on the fifteenth of Adar, <b>as Rav Shemen bar Abba said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> The verse <b>“to confirm</b> these <b>days of Purim in their appointed times”</b> (Esther 9:31) teaches that <b>the Sages instituted many times for their</b> reading, and it is prohibited to deviate from these dates. <b>And you speak to me</b> about <b>a custom</b> that does not involve a prohibition. How can a prohibition be established in a manner that involves the formation of factions among the people?",
        "Rabbi Yoḥanan replied: <b>And</b> in that case <b>there,</b> on Passover eve, is <b>there no prohibition</b> involved? <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna: <b>On the night</b> before the fourteenth of Nisan, <b>Beit Shammai prohibit</b> the performance of work <b>and Beit Hillel permit it.</b> Evidently, there is indeed a prohibition involved, and yet some perform work while others do not, which splits the people into factions.",
        "Reish Lakish <b>said to him:</b> In that case <b>there,</b> the different factions are not noticeable, as <b>one who sees</b> another idle <b>says: It is</b> because <b>he has no labor</b> to perform. Therefore, refraining from work does not have the appearance of breaking off into factions. Rabbi Yoḥanan raises a difficulty: <b>But Beit Shammai permit rival wives to the brothers, and Beit Hillel prohibit</b> this practice. This is an example of a clear prohibition, and yet two different traditions were followed."
      ],
      [
        "Reish Lakish said to him: <b>Do you hold</b> that <b>Beit Shammai</b> actually <b>acted in accordance with their</b> own <b>statement? Beit Shammai did not</b> in fact <b>act in accordance with their</b> own <b>statement,</b> as the dispute was merely theoretical. <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> Beit Shammai <b>certainly did act</b> in accordance with their opinion. The Gemara comments: <b>And</b> this is also reflected <b>in the dispute between Rav and Shmuel, as Rav says: Beit Shammai did not act in accordance with their</b> own <b>statement, and Shmuel said: They certainly did act</b> in that manner.",
        "The Gemara inquires: <b>When</b> does this question apply? <b>If we say</b> that it is referring to the period <b>prior to</b> the <b>Divine Voice</b> that declared that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Beit Hillel, then <b>what is the rationale of the one who said that</b> Beit Shammai <b>did not act</b> in accordance with their opinion? <b>But rather,</b> if one would say it is referring to <b>after</b> the <b>Divine Voice, what is the reason for the one who said</b> that <b>they did act</b> in accordance with their opinion? After all, the Divine Voice established that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Beit Hillel.",
        "The Gemara answers: Neither of these options poses a difficulty. <b>If you wish, say</b> that it is referring to the period <b>prior to</b> the <b>Divine Voice, and if you wish, say</b> instead that it is <b>after</b> the <b>Divine Voice.</b> The Gemara elaborates: <b>If you wish, say</b> it is <b>prior to</b> the <b>Divine Voice, and</b> it is referring to the period <b>when Beit Hillel</b> formed <b>the majority</b> of the Sages. Therefore, <b>according to the one who said</b> that Beit Shammai <b>did not act</b> in accordance with their opinion, the reason is <b>that Beit Hillel</b> was <b>the majority,</b> and the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the majority.",
        "<b>And the one who said</b> that <b>they did act</b> in accordance with their opinion maintains that <b>when do we follow the majority?</b> It is in a case <b>where</b> the disputing parties <b>are equal</b> in wisdom <b>to one another. Here,</b> however, <b>Beit Shammai are sharper</b> than Beit Hillel, and therefore they acted in accordance with their own opinion despite the fact that they were in the minority.",
        "<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that it was <b>after</b> the <b>Divine Voice. The one who said</b> that Beit Shammai <b>did not act</b> in accordance with their opinion would say <b>that</b> this was due to the <b>pronouncement</b> of the <b>Divine Voice. And the one who said</b> that <b>they did do so, this is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehoshua, who said,</b> with regard to the Divine Voice that emerged and proclaimed that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer in the case of the oven of <i>akhnai</i> (<i>Bava Metzia</i> 59b), that <b>one disregards a Heavenly Voice.</b> Just as he disregarded the Divine Voice in his dispute with Rabbi Eliezer, so too, one disregards the Divine Voice that proclaimed that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Beit Hillel.",
        "<b>And</b> yet the question remains: According to <b>the one who said</b> that Beit Shammai <b>acted</b> in accordance with their opinion, <b>we</b> should <b>read here: “You shall not cut yourselves”</b> (Deuteronomy 14:1), which is interpreted to mean: <b>Do not become numerous factions. Abaye said: When we say</b> that the prohibition: <b>“You shall not cut yourselves”</b> applies, we are referring to a case <b>where two courts</b> are located <b>in one city,</b> and <b>these rule in accordance with the statement of Beit Shammai and those rule in accordance with the statement of Beit Hillel. However,</b> with regard to <b>two courts</b> located <b>in two</b> different <b>cities, we have no</b> problem <b>with it.</b>",
        "<b>Rava said to him: But</b> the dispute between <b>Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel is considered like</b> a case of <b>two courts in one city,</b> as these two schools of thought were found everywhere, not in any specific place. <b>Rather, Rava said: When we say</b> that the prohibition: <b>“You shall not cut yourselves”</b> applies, we are referring to a case <b>where</b> there is <b>a court in one city, a section</b> of which <b>rules in accordance with the statement of Beit Shammai and</b> another <b>section rules in accordance with the statement of Beit Hillel. However,</b> with regard to <b>two courts</b> located <b>in one city, we have no</b> problem <b>with it.</b>",
        "§ The Gemara cites other relevant sources. <b>Come</b> and <b>hear: In the locale of Rabbi Eliezer,</b> where his ruling was followed, <b>they would cut down trees</b> on Shabbat <b>to prepare charcoal</b> from them <b>to fashion iron</b> tools with which to circumcise a child <b>on Shabbat.</b> In Rabbi Eliezer’s opinion, not only does the mitzva of circumcision override Shabbat, but also any action required for the preparation of the tools necessary for the circumcision likewise overrides Shabbat. The <i>baraita</i> adds: <b>In the locale of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili they would eat poultry meat in milk,</b> as Rabbi Yosei HaGelili held that the prohibition of meat in milk does not include poultry.",
        "The Gemara infers: <b>In the locale of Rabbi Eliezer, yes,</b> they would act in this manner, whereas <b>in the locale of Rabbi Akiva,</b> for instance, <b>no,</b> they would not do so, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>a principle was stated by Rabbi Akiva: Any prohibited labor that can be performed on Shabbat eve does not override Shabbat</b> even if it involves a mitzva. A mitzva whose proper time is on Shabbat overrides Shabbat only if its performance was impossible earlier, e.g., the act of circumcision itself, which cannot be performed earlier.",
        "The Gemara asks: <b>And what is this refutation?</b> As stated above, <b>it is different</b> when dealing <b>with numerous places,</b> and the <i>baraita</i> explicitly states that this practice was followed in Rabbi Eliezer’s locale. Consequently, there is no violation of the prohibition against splitting into factions. The Gemara asks: <b>He who asked it, why did he ask it,</b> i.e., what is the basis for the question in the first place? It is obvious that the <i>baraita</i> is referring to a specific place.",
        "The Gemara answers: It might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that <b>due to the severity of Shabbat, it,</b> i.e., the world, <b>is considered like a single locale.</b> In other words, one might have thought that the permission to tolerate diverse customs in different places applies only to other prohibitions, whereas the prohibition of Shabbat is so severe that it is unacceptable to allow different customs, as this might lead people to disrespect Shabbat. Therefore, the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches us</b> that even in the case of Shabbat there can be different customs in various locales.",
        "§ The Gemara cites another relevant case involving Shabbat: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear that Rabbi Abbahu, when he happened</b> to come <b>to the place of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi, would move</b> an oil <b>lamp [<i>sheraga</i>]</b> after the flame that had been lit for that Shabbat had burned out, as Rabbi Yehoshua accepted the ruling that it is permitted to carry items of this sort that had been set aside. <b>But when he happened</b> to come <b>to the place of Rabbi Yoḥanan,</b> who prohibited carrying items of this kind that had been set aside on Shabbat, <b>he would not move</b> an oil <b>lamp.</b> This indicates that divergent customs are followed in different places.",
        "Again, the Gemara asks: <b>And what is this difficulty? Didn’t we say</b> that <b>it is different</b> when dealing <b>with numerous places?</b> The Gemara explains that <b>this is what we are saying:</b> With regard to <b>Rabbi Abbahu</b> himself, <b>how could he act in this manner here and how could he act in that manner there?</b>",
        "The Gemara answers: <b>Rabbi Abbahu holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi</b> that it is permitted to carry this item. <b>And when he happened</b> to come <b>to the place of Rabbi Yoḥanan he would not carry it, in deference to Rabbi Yoḥanan,</b> so as not to act contrary to his ruling in the place where he was the authority. The Gemara asks: <b>But there was a servant</b> accompanying Rabbi Abbahu who would see him carrying these types of articles that had been set aside. Wasn’t Rabbi Abbahu concerned that the servant might carry them in Rabbi Yoḥanan’s locale? The Gemara explains <b>that he would inform the servant</b> and explain to him the reason for his change in behavior.",
        "§ The Gemara continues to discuss the question of whether Beit Shammai followed their own rulings. <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> that which is taught in the mishna: <b>Although</b> Beit Hillel <b>prohibit and</b> Beit Shammai <b>permit,</b> and these disqualify the women and those deem them fit, <b>Beit Shammai did not refrain from marrying women from Beit Hillel, nor did Beit Hillel</b> refrain from marrying women <b>from Beit Shammai. Granted, if you say</b> that Beit Shammai <b>did not act</b> in accordance with their opinion, it is <b>due to that</b> reason that <b>they did not</b> have to <b>refrain</b> from marrying women from Beit Hillel. <b>However, if you say</b> that <b>they did act</b> in accordance with their opinion, <b>why didn’t they refrain</b> from marrying one another?",
        "The Gemara elaborates: <b>Granted, Beit Shammai did not refrain</b> from marrying into <b>Beit Hillel,</b> as even if Beit Shammai maintain in a certain case that a rival wife required levirate marriage or <i>ḥalitza</i>, if she went ahead and married another man their <b>children are</b> born to a union whose partners are <b>liable by</b> a regular <b>prohibition:</b> “The wife of the dead man shall not be married outside” (Deuteronomy 25:5). Since this transgression does not entail <i>karet</i>, the children of this relationship are not <i>mamzerim</i>.",
        "<b>However, why did Beit Hillel not refrain</b> from marrying into <b>Beit Shammai?</b> In the opinion of Beit Hillel the <b>children</b> of these rival wives who entered into levirate marriage are born of a union whose partners are <b>liable to</b> receive <b><i>karet</i>,</b> as the prohibition of a brother’s wife was never nullified in this case, which means that the children <b>are <i>mamzerim</i>.</b> If so, how could Beit Hillel allow these marriages?",
        "<b>And if you would say</b> that <b>Beit Hillel maintain that</b> the child of a union whose partners are <b>liable to</b> receive <b><i>karet</i> is not a <i>mamzer</i>,</b> as a <i>mamzer</i> is only one whose parents violated a prohibition that entails the death penalty, <b>didn’t Rabbi Elazar say: Although Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel disagreed</b> with regard <b>to rival wives, they concede that a <i>mamzer</i> is only from</b> a union <b>whose prohibition</b> is <b>a prohibition of forbidden relations punishable by <i>karet</i>?</b> Consequently, the children of rival wives are <i>mamzerim</i> according to Beit Hillel. <b>Rather, isn’t it</b> correct to <b>conclude from</b> here that Beit Shammai <b>did not act</b> in accordance with their own opinion?",
        "The Gemara rejects this conclusion: <b>No; actually,</b> Beit Shammai <b>did act</b> in accordance with their opinion. As for the problem with these marriages, the answer is <b>that they would inform</b> Beit Hillel <b>and</b> Beit Hillel would <b>withdraw</b> from the match. When those who acted in accordance with the opinion of Beit Hillel would come to marry women from those who followed the rulings of Beit Shammai, they would be notified that certain children were born of rival wives and that those people were considered <i>mamzerim</i> in the opinion of Beit Hillel, who therefore declared them forbidden in marriage.",
        "The Gemara comments: <b>And so too, it is reasonable</b> that this is the case, <b>as</b> the mishna <b>teaches</b> in <b>the latter clause:</b> With regard to <b>all of the</b> disputes concerning the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>ritual purity and impurity, where those,</b> Beit Hillel, rule an article <b>ritually pure and these,</b> Beit Shammai, rule it <b>ritually impure, they did not refrain from handling ritually pure</b> objects <b>each with the other.</b>"
      ],
      [
        "<b>Granted, if you say that they notified them,</b> it is <b>due to that</b> reason that <b>they did not</b> need to <b>refrain</b> from using their objects. <b>However, if you say</b> that <b>they did not notify them, granted,</b> it is logical that <b>Beit Shammai did not refrain from</b> handling items belonging to <b>Beit Hillel, as ritually impure</b> objects <b>for Beit Hillel are ritually pure for Beit Shammai,</b> and therefore no special care is necessary.",
        "<b>However, why didn’t Beit Hillel refrain from</b> touching articles that belonged to <b>Beit Shammai?</b> After all, <b>ritually pure</b> objects <b>for Beit Shammai are ritually impure for Beit Hillel. Rather, is it not</b> the case that Beit Shammai <b>notified</b> Beit Hillel that these items were ritually pure only in their own opinion, and Beit Hillel separated themselves from them? The Gemara summarizes the discussion: <b>Conclude from</b> here that this is the correct interpretation.",
        "The Gemara asks: <b>In what</b> way <b>is this</b> case <b>stronger than that</b> case? In other words, why is the statement with regard to ritual purity and impurity more conclusive than the one that deals with marriage? Since the practice of notification was not explicitly stated in the case of ritual purity but was merely inferred logically, the same reasoning applies equally to the case of marriage. The Gemara answers: <b>Lest you say</b> that since it is so unusual, a marriage to <b>a rival wife</b> generates <b>publicity</b> and is so widely known that no special notification is required, therefore, the Gemara <b>teaches us</b> that even in this case notification is required.",
        "§ Since the statement of Rabbi Elazar was mentioned, the Gemara turns to discuss <b>the</b> matter <b>itself. Rabbi Elazar said: Although Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel disagreed</b> with regard <b>to rival wives, they concede that a <i>mamzer</i> is only from</b> a union <b>whose prohibition</b> is <b>a prohibition of forbidden relations punishable by <i>karet</i>.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Who concedes</b> to whom? <b>If we say</b> that <b>Beit Shammai</b> concede <b>to Beit Hillel,</b> this is <b>obvious,</b> since if they acted in accordance with their own opinion that rival wives who married others without <i>ḥalitza</i> <b>are liable</b> only <b>for</b> violating a regular <b>prohibition,</b> their <b>children are</b> therefore <b>fit</b> and are not <i>mamzerim</i> at all.",
        "<b>Rather,</b> one could say that <b>Beit Hillel</b> concede <b>to Beit Shammai.</b> But in that case <b>she herself,</b> the rival wife of a forbidden relative who married one of the <i>yevamin</i>, <b>is liable to</b> receive <b><i>karet</i></b> in the opinion of Beit Hillel, and the child is a <i>mamzer</i>, whereas Rabbi Elazar’s statement indicates that they concede with regard to a different case.",
        "The Gemara explains: <b>Actually, Beit Shammai</b> concede <b>to Beit Hillel,</b> and this is not a novelty with regard to their basic dispute. Instead, the statement comes <b>to exclude</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Akiva, who said:</b> The offspring <b>from</b> forbidden relations for which one is <b>liable for</b> violating <b>a prohibition is a <i>mamzer</i>.</b> Rabbi Elazar <b>teaches us</b> that Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel agree that the offspring <b>from</b> forbidden relations for which one is <b>liable for</b> violating <b>a prohibition is not a <i>mamzer</i>;</b> rather, one is a <i>mamzer</i> only if he is born of a union punishable by <i>karet</i>.",
        "§ The Gemara returns to the initial question of whether or not Beit Shammai acted in accordance with their own opinion. The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear: Although Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel disagreed</b> with regard <b>to</b> several cases, nevertheless, they did not refrain from marrying women from each other’s communities. The cases with regard to which they disagreed include <b>rival wives, and sisters,</b> i.e., if two sisters had been married to two brothers and simultaneously became obligated in levirate marriage, Beit Hillel prohibit both in levirate marriage, and if they violated the prohibition and married regardless, they require a divorce. By contrast, Beit Shammai permit them to remain married.",
        "Furthermore, Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel disagreed with regard <b>to an outdated bill of divorce</b> that had been written but not delivered. Beit Shammai maintain that if the husband and wife continued to live together after the writing of the bill of divorce, the same bill of divorce can still be used later, whereas Beit Hillel dispute this. <b>And</b> they likewise <b>disagreed</b> with regard <b>to an uncertain married woman,</b> i.e., whether a minor who was actually married, and not merely betrothed, may perform refusal. <b>And</b> they also <b>disagreed</b> with regard <b>to one who divorces his wife and</b> later <b>she lodged</b> together <b>with him at an inn,</b> as to whether or not this is sufficient grounds for assuming that they remarried.",
        "Additionally, they disagreed with regard to the issue of betrothal <b>by money and with</b> the equivalent <b>value of money,</b> and <b>by a <i>peruta</i> or with</b> the equivalent <b>value of a <i>peruta</i>.</b> According to Beit Shammai, the minimal amount of money effective for betrothal is a dinar or the equivalent of a dinar, whereas Beit Hillel maintain that even the less valuable <i>peruta</i> or its equivalent is sufficient.",
        "Despite the fact that these <i>halakhot</i> entail important ramifications depending on whether or not these women were married or fit for marriage, or whether their offspring are fit for marriage, <b>Beit Shammai did not refrain from marrying women from Beit Hillel, nor did Beit Hillel</b> refrain from marrying women <b>from Beit Shammai.</b> This serves <b>to teach you that</b> they <b>practiced affection and camaraderie between them, to fulfill that which is stated: “Love truth and peace”</b> (Zechariah 8:19). <b>Rabbi Shimon says: They did refrain in the certain</b> cases, <b>but they did not refrain in the uncertain</b> cases. In other words, Beit Hillel were not worried that any ordinary woman from Beit Shammai might be one of those of uncertain status.",
        "The Gemara infers from the opinion of Rabbi Shimon: <b>Granted, if you say</b> that Beit Shammai <b>did act</b> in accordance with their opinion, it is <b>due to that</b> reason that <b>they refrained</b> in the certain cases. <b>However, if you say</b> that <b>they did not act</b> in accordance with their opinion, <b>why did they refrain</b> from marriage? The Gemara replies: <b>And</b> how can <b>you understand</b> it that way, that Beit Shammai acted in accordance with their opinion? <b>Even if they acted</b> in accordance with their opinion, <b>granted</b> that <b>Beit Hillel refrained from</b> marrying into <b>Beit Shammai,</b> as <b>those</b> rival wives who entered into levirate marriage <b>are liable to</b> receive <b><i>karet</i> and</b> their children <b>are <i>mamzerim</i> according to</b> the opinion of <b>Beit Hillel.</b>",
        "<b>However, why did Beit Shammai refrain from</b> marrying the offspring of rival wives of <b>Beit Hillel?</b> The parents are <b>liable for</b> violating a regular <b>prohibition, and</b> therefore their children <b>are fit.</b> The Gemara answers <b>as Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said</b> with regard to a different matter: <b>This</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>was necessary</b> not for the children of the rival wife, but <b>only for the rival wife herself. Here too, it was necessary only for the rival wife herself.</b> The <i>halakha</i> was not taught with regard to the children of the rival wives; rather, it is referring only to the rival wives.",
        "The Gemara asks further: <b>And in what</b> way are uncertain cases <b>different from the certain</b> cases, such as forbidden rival wives? If you say <b>that</b> certain cases are undoubtedly <b>prohibited</b> in the opinion of Beit Hillel, the cases involving <b>uncertain</b> circumstances, e.g., one who divorced his wife and then stayed with her in the same inn, <b>are also prohibited.</b> Even if Beit Hillel render these cases prohibited only due to some uncertainty, the ruling is the same.",
        "The Gemara answers: <b>Do not say: In the uncertain</b> cases, i.e., that the <i>halakha</i> involved doubtful circumstances. <b>Rather, say: From the unspecified</b> case. In other words, barring clear knowledge of an uncertain betrothal within a specific family, they would take women from that family in marriage. The reason is <b>that</b> Beit Shammai <b>would notify</b> Beit Hillel of the prohibition according to their opinion, <b>and</b> they would <b>refrain</b> from the marriage. If there was no notification, this was a clear sign that no doubt was involved in this case at all.",
        "The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if so, <b>what</b> does <b>this</b> come to <b>teach us?</b> Is it <b>that</b> they had <b>relations of affection and camaraderie between them,</b> i.e., that each trusted that the other side would never cause them to err with regard to something they held to be prohibited? <b>This is</b> the same as the <b>first clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i>. What is Rabbi Shimon adding by his statement? The Gemara answers: This comes to <b>teach us that the entire</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>is</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon.</b> This is not a dispute between two Sages. Rather, Rabbi Shimon’s opinion elucidates the earlier statement.",
        "§ The Gemara offers an alternative resolution: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear, as Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri said: How should</b> one act with regard to <b>this <i>halakha</i></b> of rival wives? In what form should it <b>become widespread among the Jewish people?</b> If <b>we act in accordance with the statement of Beit Shammai</b> and permit a rival wife in levirate marriage, <b>the offspring</b> will be <b>a <i>mamzer</i> according to the statement of Beit Hillel.</b> If <b>we act in accordance with the statement of Beit Hillel</b> and grant full exemption to the rival wives, <b>the offspring will</b> be of <b>flawed</b> lineage <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>Beit Shammai,</b> as he is the child of a woman prohibited in marriage by a regular prohibition. Although he is not a <i>mamzer</i>, his lineage is nevertheless defective. Instead, <b>let us enact</b> a general decree <b>for rival wives</b>"
      ],
      [
        "that they <b>should perform <i>ḥalitza</i> and not enter into levirate marriage.</b> If they act in this manner, they will be permitted to marry others and the problem will be solved according to all opinions. <b>They were unable to finalize the matter</b> according to the proposition raised by Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri <b>before times of trouble</b> arrived. Due to the outbreak of war they were unable to gather together to vote and establish an accepted halakhic ruling.",
        "Sometime later, when they returned to discuss the issue, <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel said to</b> the other Sages: <b>What shall we do with those earlier rival wives from now</b> onward? Since in the meantime some rival wives had entered into levirate marriage, if we issue a collective ruling that rival wives may not do so, their children will be declared <i>mamzerim</i>. Therefore, it is better not to establish this <i>halakha</i> at all.",
        "The Gemara analyzes this episode in relation to the matter at hand. <b>Granted, if you say</b> that Beit Shammai <b>did act</b> in accordance with their own opinion, <b>this is</b> the meaning of <b>what</b> Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel <b>said: What shall we do?</b> Since these rival wives had already entered into levirate marriage, it was impossible to change the status of their children retroactively. <b>However, if you say</b> that <b>they did not act</b> in accordance with their opinion, <b>what is</b> the meaning of: <b>What shall we do?</b> If Beit Shammai did not act upon their ruling, they never actually permitted a <i>yavam</i> to take a rival wife in levirate marriage.",
        "<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said:</b> This amendment was <b>necessary,</b> not for the benefit of the children of rival wives, as Beit Shammai never in fact acted on their ruling; <b>rather,</b> it was necessary <b>only for the rival wife herself.</b> If these rival wives married others, in the opinion of Beit Shammai their marriages were flawed, as they did not perform <i>ḥalitza</i>. And as for the question: <b>What shall we do, this is what</b> Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel <b>is saying:</b> With regard to <b>those rival wives</b> who were entirely exempt according <b>to Beit Hillel, what</b> should <b>we do with them</b> according <b>to Beit Shammai,</b> as these rival wives had already married others without performing <i>ḥalitza</i>?",
        "The Gemara elaborates: If you say <b>let them perform <i>ḥalitza</i>, they will be repulsive to their husbands,</b> as it will seem to the husband that the woman he has been living with for some time suddenly requires a permit for marriage. <b>And if you would say, let them be repulsive</b> to their husbands, as that is not our concern, this is not the case, as the Torah says: <b>“Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace”</b> (Proverbs 3:17).",
        "§ The Gemara suggests further: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> another source, <b>as Rabbi Tarfon said: I yearn</b> for the following scenario: <b>When shall my daughter’s rival wife come before me and I will marry her?</b> In other words, in this hypothetical case I would act in accordance with the opinion of Beit Shammai and take her in levirate marriage. This statement indicates that those who held by the traditions of Beit Shammai did indeed act upon their opinion. The Gemara amends this statement. <b>Say: And I will marry her off,</b> i.e., I shall act in accordance with the opinion of Beit Hillel and marry her off to others.",
        "The Gemara asks: <b>But he said: I yearn,</b> and if he meant that he would follow the ruling of Beit Hillel, which is the common practice, what is the novelty of Rabbi Tarfon’s statement? The Gemara responds: Rabbi Tarfon comes <b>to exclude</b> the statement of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri,</b> who maintains that all rival wives perform <i>ḥalitza</i>. Rabbi Tarfon yearned for an opportunity to demonstrate that the <i>halakha</i> is not in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri.",
        "The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear an incident involving Rabban Gamliel’s daughter, who was married to Abba, his brother, and</b> Abba <b>died childless, and Rabban Gamliel entered into levirate marriage with her rival wife.</b> This is apparently conclusive proof that the rival wife of a daughter may enter into levirate marriage. The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how can <b>you understand it</b> that way? Was <b>Rabban Gamliel among the disciples of Beit Shammai?</b> In fact, Rabban Gamliel, who was a descendant of Hillel himself, certainly followed the opinion of Beit Hillel.",
        "<b>Rather,</b> the case of <b>Rabban Gamliel’s daughter is different, as she was a sexually underdeveloped woman [<i>aylonit</i>],</b> and therefore the prohibition against marrying her rival wife does not apply, as explicitly stated in the mishna. The Gemara asks: But <b>from</b> the fact <b>that it is taught</b> in <b>the latter clause</b> of the same <i>baraita</i>: <b>Others say</b> that <b>Rabban Gamliel’s daughter was an <i>aylonit</i>,</b> it can be derived <b>by inference that the first <i>tanna</i> holds</b> that <b>she was not an <i>aylonit</i>.</b>",
        "The Gemara answers: The dispute between the <i>tanna’im</i> was not about whether or not she was an <i>aylonit</i>, as she certainly was. Rather, the practical difference <b>between them</b> is whether <b>he knew</b> that <b>she</b> was an <i>aylonit</i> at the time of marriage and decided to marry her regardless. Some maintain in general that if the husband was aware of her condition prior to marriage, her rival wife is forbidden, <b>but</b> if <b>he did not know about her</b> status, the rival wife is permitted.",
        "<b>And if you wish, say</b> that the practical difference <b>between them</b> concerns a different case, that of one who <b>married and ultimately divorced.</b> This is referring to an issue discussed above of whether a woman is considered the rival wife of a forbidden relation simply by virtue of her marriage to the specific man or whether she must be married to him at the time when the mitzva of levirate obligation takes effect, i.e., at the time of the brother’s death.",
        "<b>And if you wish, say</b> that the practical difference <b>between them</b> concerns a case where <b>there is a condition in sexual relations.</b> In other words, the first <i>tanna</i> holds that Rabban Gamliel’s daughter was married only conditionally, and since the condition was never fulfilled the marriage was nullified. Consequently, Rabban Gamliel could marry the other wife regardless of his daughter’s status as an <i>aylonit</i>, as she was never married to his brother at all. However, according to the other <i>tanna</i>, even if the marriage was dependent upon a condition that was not fulfilled, because the man engaged in sexual relations with her the act of intercourse itself serves to nullify the condition. Accordingly, he maintains that the only reason Rabban Gamliel could enter into levirate marriage with his daughter’s rival wife was not because of the condition, but due to the fact that his daughter was an <i>aylonit</i>. Whichever explanation is accepted, this case provides no proof with regard to the issue of whether or not Beit Shammai acted in accordance with their ruling.",
        "§ <b>Rav Mesharshiyya raised an objection</b> against those who claim that Beit Shammai did not act in accordance with their opinion. It is taught in a mishna: There was <b>an incident involving Rabbi Akiva, who collected an <i>etrog</i> on the first of</b> the month of <b>Shevat and performed with it two tenths.</b> In other words, he separated two tithes from the fruit, as though it belonged to two different tithing years. He removed both the second tithe and the poor man’s tithe at the same time, two tithes that should not be separated in the same year.",
        "The mishna explains: <b>One</b> tithe he removed <b>in accordance with the statement of Beit Shammai,</b> who hold that the new year for trees occurs on the first of Shevat, which means that the <i>etrog</i> required tithing according to the regulations of the upcoming year. <b>And one</b> tithe was <b>in accordance with the statement of Beit Hillel,</b> who hold the new year for trees is on the fifteenth of Shevat, and therefore the <i>etrog</i> required tithing in accordance with the previous year. The Gemara infers: <b>Conclude from here</b> that Beit Shammai <b>did act</b> in accordance with their opinion, as Rabbi Akiva took care to act in accordance with the ruling of Beit Shammai.",
        "The Gemara answers: <b>Rabbi Akiva was uncertain as to his tradition, and he did not know if Beit Hillel said</b> that the New Year for trees occurs <b>on the first of Shevat or if they said</b> it is <b>on the fifteenth of Shevat.</b> He did not act in accordance with the opinion of Beit Shammai at all; rather, he sought to act in accordance with the ruling of Beit Hillel but was uncertain about their opinion on this matter.",
        "§ <b>Mar Zutra raised an objection</b> to this issue from a different source: There was <b>an incident in which the daughter-in-law of Shammai the Elder gave birth</b> to a son. In Shammai’s opinion this newborn baby is immediately obligated in the mitzva to sit in a <i>sukka</i>, <b>and he</b> therefore <b>removed the mortar [<i>ma’aziva</i>]</b> covering the ceiling <b>and he placed</b> <i>sukka</i> <b>covering over the bed for the minor. Conclude from here</b> that Beit Shammai <b>did act</b> in accordance with their opinions. The Gemara answers: There is no proof from <b>there,</b> as anyone <b>watching</b> would <b>say</b> that <b>he did it</b> merely <b>to increase</b> the <b>air.</b> Since people would not necessarily think that he removed the mortar as a ruling of <i>halakha</i>, this behavior is not considered the formation of a faction.",
        "<b>Mar Zutra raised</b> a further <b>objection:</b> There was <b>an incident involving the Yehu water trough in Jerusalem, which had a hole</b> that connected it <b>to a ritual bath, and all the ritual purifications in Jerusalem were performed in it,</b> i.e., people immersed their utensils in this trough. <b>And Beit Shammai sent</b> messengers <b>and they widened</b> the opening in the water trough, as in the opinion of Beit Shammai the hole was not large enough for the trough to be considered connected to the adjacent ritual bath <b>as Beit Shammai say:</b> The two areas are not connected <b>unless the majority of it is opened.</b> In other words, they require the major portion of the barrier between the ritual bath and the nearby trough to be open.",
        "<b>And we learned</b> in a mishna: Beit Hillel hold that <b>a joining of ritual baths</b> is effective if the hole has the <b>width of the tube</b> used to pour water in and out <b>of a wineskin, and in its</b> open <b>space</b> there is enough room for <b>about two fingers that can return to their place.</b> In other words, if it is possible to insert into the hole two fingers that can move around on all sides, the cavity is sufficiently large to be considered a connection. According to Beit Shammai, however, the hole must open up the majority of the barrier between the two areas. If so, <b>conclude from this</b> that Beit Shammai <b>did act</b> in accordance with their opinions. The Gemara rejects this contention: <b>There,</b>"
      ],
      [
        "anyone <b>watching</b> would <b>say</b> that <b>he did</b> it <b>to increase the water</b> flow, and he did not intend to change the <i>halakha</i>. Rather, they would think that he widened the water trough only because there was not enough water flow.",
        "§ The Gemara cites another relevant source. <b>Come</b> and <b>hear, as Rabbi Elazar bar Tzadok said: When I studied Torah with Rabbi Yoḥanan the Ḥorani,</b> who was a disciple of Beit Shammai, <b>I saw that he would eat dry bread in salt in years of drought. I went and informed</b> my <b>father</b> of his meager meal, and <b>he said to me: Take olives</b> for <b>him, and I took</b> for <b>him</b> some olives. Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>saw that they were moist</b> with the liquid that oozes from olives, which renders them susceptible to ritual impurity. Concerned that they had already become ritually impure, <b>he said to me: I do not eat olives.</b> He spoke politely and stated that he did not eat olives because he did not wish to embarrass his benefactor by disclosing that he feared they had become ritually impure.",
        "Rabbi Elazar bar Tzadok continued his account. <b>I went and informed</b> my <b>father. He said to me: Go and say to him</b> that the <b>barrel</b> containing the olives <b>was perforated, but it was clogged by sediments</b> in the oil and therefore some moisture remained inside. However, due to the presence of the hole, the olives were not rendered susceptible to ritual impurity. <b>And we learned</b> this in a mishna: With regard to <b>a barrel of preserved olives, Beit Shammai say it does not need to be perforated,</b> as the juice issuing from the olives does not render them susceptible to ritual impurity.",
        "<b>And Beit Hillel say</b> that <b>it does need to be perforated,</b> as they maintain that the juice of olives is considered oil and it therefore renders the olives susceptible to ritual impurity. <b>And</b> Beit Hillel <b>concede that if</b> the barrel <b>was perforated and</b> subsequently <b>clogged by sediments it is ritually pure,</b> despite the moisture on the olives. Since liquids render food susceptible to ritual impurity only if they were placed on them intentionally, the hole in the barrel clearly shows that one did not intend for the juice to be there. By boring a hole in the barrel he has rendered it obvious that he did not desire the presence of the olive juices, and therefore it does not matter that the hole became blocked.",
        "The <i>baraita</i> adds: <b>And although</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan the Ḥorani <b>was a disciple of Shammai, he always acted only in accordance with the statements of Beit Hillel.</b> The Gemara infers: <b>Granted, if you say</b> that Beit Shammai <b>acted</b> in accordance with their opinions, <b>this is</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan the Ḥorani’s <b>greatness,</b> i.e., he is praised for acting in accordance with the opinion of Beit Hillel. <b>However, if you say</b> that Beit Shammai <b>did not act</b> in accordance with their own rulings, <b>what is the greatness</b> and uniqueness <b>of</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan the Ḥorani? From here it can be inferred that Beit Shammai generally did act in accordance with their opinions.",
        "§ The Gemara adds: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a different proof. <b>They asked Rabbi Yehoshua: What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the <b>rival wife of a daughter? He said to them:</b> It is a matter of <b>dispute between Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel.</b> They continued to ask him: <b>And in accordance with whose statement is the <i>halakha</i>? He said to them: Why are you inserting my head between two great mountains,</b> i.e., <b>between two great disputing</b> opinions, <b>between Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel? I fear lest</b> these two mountains <b>break my skull.</b>",
        "<b>However, I shall testify to you about two great families that were in Jerusalem, the Beit Tzevo’im family</b> who came <b>from</b> the town of <b>Ben Akhmai, and the Beit Kofai family from</b> the town of <b>Ben Mekoshesh: They were the descendants of rival wives</b> who married others, in accordance with the opinion of Beit Hillel, <b>and from them</b> came <b>High Priests who served on the altar.</b> Accordingly, I can testify that this was the accepted halakhic practice throughout the generations.",
        "The Gemara infers from this statement: <b>Granted, if you say</b> that Beit Shammai <b>acted</b> in accordance with their opinions, <b>this is why</b> Rabbi Yehoshua <b>said: I fear,</b> since a conclusive halakhic ruling would mean that certain children are <i>mamzerim</i>, and the descendants of that family might take vengeance upon him. <b>However, if you say</b> that <b>they did not act</b> in accordance with their opinions, <b>why did he say: I fear?</b> The Gemara retorts: <b>And even</b> if Beit Shammai <b>did act</b> in accordance with their rulings, <b>what is</b> the reason that he said: <b>I fear?</b>",
        "<b>Didn’t Rabbi Yehoshua say</b> that in his opinion <b>a <i>mamzer</i> is only</b> someone born <b>from</b> a union <b>of those liable to</b> receive <b>the court-imposed capital punishments,</b> not from those liable to receive <i>karet</i>. If so, in the opinion of Rabbi Yehoshua, the children of rival wives who entered into levirate marriage would not be <i>mamzerim</i> at all, and therefore he had no reason to fear reprisals. The Gemara answers: <b>Even if</b> this is the case, nevertheless, he had something to fear, as, although the child of a rival wife would <b>not be a <i>mamzer</i>,</b> he would <b>nevertheless be</b> of <b>flawed</b> lineage and disqualified from the priesthood.",
        "The Gemara adds that this can be derived <b>by an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference <b>from</b> the case of <b>a widow: Just as</b> in the case of <b>a widow, whose prohibition does not apply to all,</b> as she is forbidden in marriage only to a High Priest and not to any other man, <b>and</b> yet the lineage of <b>her son is flawed,</b> as he is disqualified from the priesthood, the son of <b>this</b> rival wife should certainly be disqualified from the priesthood, as <b>her prohibition applies equally to all,</b> even regular Israelites.",
        "§ Incidentally, the Gemara notes a problem with the above discussion: <b>They asked</b> Rabbi Yehoshua about <b>rival wives, and he answered them</b> about <b>the children of rival wives.</b> He did not refer to the rival wives themselves. The Gemara explains: <b>They asked him</b> questions on <b>two</b> matters: First, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>rival wives? And if you say</b> that the <i>halakha</i> in the case of <b>rival wives</b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Beit Hillel</b> and they are exempt, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>according to Beit Shammai</b> in the case of <b>the children of rival wives</b> who, following <b>Beit Hillel,</b> married others without <i>ḥalitza</i>?",
        "The Gemara asks: <b>What difference</b> does this question make? Since Rabbi Yehoshua maintains that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the ruling of Beit Hillel, why even discuss Beit Shammai’s opinion on this matter? The Gemara explains: His answer enables one <b>to resolve</b> a different issue, the case of a <b>child of one who remarries his divorcée according to</b> the opinion of <b>Beit Hillel.</b> Is the child of a divorcée who remarried her previous husband after she had been married to another man fit or disqualified from the priesthood?",
        "The Gemara elaborates: <b>Do we say</b> the following <b>an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference: <b>And just as</b> with regard to <b>a widow</b> married <b>to a High Priest, whose prohibition does not apply to all,</b> as she is prohibited in marriage only to a High Priest, <b>and</b> yet the lineage of <b>her son is flawed</b> as he is disqualified from the priesthood, so too, in the case of <b>this</b> rival wife, <b>whose prohibition applies equally to all</b> men, <b>is it not right that her son</b> should be of <b>flawed</b> lineage?",
        "<b>Or perhaps</b> this comparison <b>can be refuted: What</b> about the fact <b>that a widow</b> is different, <b>as she herself is disqualified</b> from marrying a priest, i.e., if a High Priest has intercourse with her she is disqualified from marrying any member of the entire priesthood, including common priests, whereas a remarried divorcée herself is not disqualified from marrying into the priesthood? <b>And</b> Rabbi Yehoshua <b>said to them: I fear</b> that if I issue a decisive ruling concerning <b>rival wives</b> this might lead to a conflict,"
      ],
      [
        "whereas with regard to the <b>children of rival wives, I testify to you</b> that they are not disqualified, since, as stated, their descendants served as High Priests.",
        "§ The Gemara states: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> another source that indicates Beit Shammai did act upon their opinions: <b>In the time of Rabbi Dosa ben Harkinas, the rival wife of a daughter was permitted to the brothers. Conclude from this</b> that Beit Shammai <b>did act</b> in accordance with their opinions. The Gemara summarizes these proofs: Indeed, <b>conclude from</b> these sources that Beit Shammai did put their rulings into practice."

        "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: The <i>mishnayot</i> (89a) taught that a frequent offering precedes other offerings, and also that an offering of greater sanctity precedes others. If there is <b>a frequent</b> offering <b>and</b> an offering <b>of</b> greater <b>sanctity</b> to be sacrificed, <b>which of them precedes</b> the other? Does the <b>frequent</b> offering <b>take precedence, due to</b> the fact <b>that</b> it is <b>frequent, or perhaps</b> the offering <b>of</b> greater <b>sanctity takes precedence, as</b> it is <b>of</b> greater <b>sanctity?</b> The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> the ruling of the first mishna in this chapter, that the <b>daily offerings precede</b> the <b>additional offerings</b> because they are frequent."
      ],
      [
        "<b>And even though</b> the <b>additional offerings</b> are <b>of</b> greater <b>sanctity,</b> as they are sacrificed due to the sanctity of Shabbat, the frequent offering precedes the offering of greater sanctity. The Gemara rejects this proof: <b>Is that to say</b> that the sanctity of <b>Shabbat affects</b> the sanctity of the <b>additional offerings</b> but does <b>not affect</b> the <b>daily offerings</b> brought on Shabbat? Rather, the sanctity of Shabbat elevates the sanctity of the daily offerings as well, and as both are of equal sanctity, the frequent daily offering precedes the additional offerings.",
        "The Gemara cites another proof: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> the continuation of this mishna: The <b>additional Shabbat offerings precede</b> the <b>additional New Moon offerings</b> because they are more frequent, despite the fact that the New Moon elevates the sanctity of its additional offerings. The Gemara rejects this proof in a similar manner: <b>Is that to say</b> that the sanctity of the <b>New Moon affects</b> the sanctity of <b>its additional offerings</b> but <b>does not affect the additional offerings of Shabbat?</b> These additional offerings are also imbued with the sanctity of the New Moon.",
        "The Gemara cites another proof: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> the continuation of this mishna: The <b>additional New Moon offerings precede</b> the <b>additional New Year offerings</b> because they are more frequent, <b>even though the New Year</b> is <b>of</b> greater <b>sanctity.</b> The Gemara rejects this proof as well: <b>Is that to say</b> that the sanctity of <b>the New Year affects</b> the sanctity of <b>its additional offerings</b> but <b>does not affect the additional offerings of</b> the <b>New Moon?</b>",
        "The Gemara cites another proof: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Berakhot</i> 5:25) that discusses the dispute between Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel with regard to the order of blessings in <i>kiddush</i>. After stating one reason for the opinion of Beit Hillel that one recites the blessing on the wine before the blessing of the sanctity of the day, the <i>Tosefta</i> adds: <b>Alternatively,</b> Beit Hillel say: <b>The blessing over wine</b> is recited <b>frequently, and the blessing over the day is not</b> recited <b>frequently, and</b> there is a principle: When <b>a frequent</b> practice <b>and an infrequent</b> practice clash, the <b>frequent</b> practice <b>takes precedence</b> over the infrequent practice. This applies <b>even though the blessing of the day</b> is <b>of</b> greater <b>sanctity,</b> as it is recited due to the sanctity of Shabbat. The Gemara rejects this proof as well: <b>Is that to say</b> that the sanctity of <b>Shabbat affects</b> the sanctity of <b>the blessing of the day</b> but <b>does not affect</b> the sanctity of <b>the blessing on the wine?</b>",
        "The Gemara cites another proof: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear, as Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> If one did not recite the additional prayer on Shabbat until the time of the afternoon prayer arrived, the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is that <b>a person prays the afternoon prayer and afterward the additional prayer,</b> as the afternoon prayer is more frequent. This ruling applies despite the fact that the additional prayer is of greater sanctity. Once again the Gemara rejects the proof: <b>Is that to say</b> that the sanctity of <b>Shabbat affects</b> the sanctity of <b>the additional prayer</b> but <b>does not affect</b> the sanctity of <b>the afternoon prayer?</b>",
        "The Gemara cites yet another proof. <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> the mishna: If one has <b>a peace offering from yesterday</b> and <b>a sin offering or a guilt offering from today, the peace offering from yesterday precedes</b> the others; this is the statement of Rabbi Meir. One can infer from this that if both <b>this</b> offering <b>and that</b> offering are <b>from today,</b> the <b>sin offering or guilt offering takes precedence, and</b> this is the <i>halakha</i> <b>even though the peace offering</b> is more <b>frequent,</b> as people sacrifice voluntary peace offerings more often than sin offerings or guilt offerings.",
        "<b>Rava said</b> in response: <b>Are you speaking</b> of <b>a common</b> offering? Although peace offerings are sacrificed more often than sin offerings, there is no obligation to sacrifice them at any particular frequency. <b>We raise the dilemma</b> only with regard to a clash between <b>a frequent</b> offering and one of greater sanctity, but <b>we do not raise the dilemma</b> with regard to <b>a common</b> offering.",
        "<b>Rav Huna bar Yehuda said to Rava: Is that to say</b> that <b>a common</b> obligation is <b>not</b> considered tantamount to <b>a frequent</b> obligation? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to positive mitzvot whose intentional neglect results in the punishment of <i>karet</i> but whose unwitting transgression does not entail the sacrifice of a sin offering: <b>I should exclude</b> the neglect of <b>the Paschal offering</b> from the obligation to sacrifice a sin offering, <b>as it is not frequent, and I should not exclude</b> the neglect of <b>the</b> mitzva of <b>circumcision, as it is frequent?</b> Circumcision is considered a frequent mitzva, as it is performed more often than the Paschal offering, despite the fact that there is no obligation to perform circumcisions at any particular frequency.",
        "Rava answers: <b>What</b> is the meaning of <b>frequent</b> in that context? It means that circumcision is <b>frequent in</b> terms of the numerous <b>mitzvot</b> commanded with regard to its fulfillment. <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that <b>circumcision in relation to</b> the <b>Paschal offering is considered like a frequent</b> obligation, as it is occurs far more often, whereas peace offerings are brought only somewhat more often than sin offerings. In sum, one cannot infer from the mishna that an offering of greater sanctity precedes a frequent offering."
