We find a similar construction where the subject is presumed without being named or being specifically referred to in 48,2 when Yaakov is informed that Joseph is about to visit him. The Torah there also uses the impersonal ויגד, “someone told,” without bothering to inform the reader who it was that informed Yaakov. All this friendliness which Joseph displayed during the meal was intended to contrast with the manner in which they, the brothers would do everything in their power to cause him anguish and discomfort prior to the time when they had sold him. He displayed especial fondness for Binyamin because he had been forced to come to Egypt on account of what must have seemed like his caprice, and to compensate him for having been separated from his father for no apparent reason. At least, these were some of the thoughts which the brothers thought of to explain Joseph’s strange behaviour.\n",

    "en": "וחטאתי לך, Yehudah did not really man that if he did not bring Binyamin back this would automatically  be a sin in the objective meaning of the word. He meant that he would consider himself as a sinner against his father forever in the unlikely event that this would happen. He would guarantee his brother’s return under such conditions. These considerations prompted our sages in Makkot 11 to characterise Yehudah as placing himself in the position of a conditional outcast, מנודה, they derive the halachah that someone who places himself in such a state requires the court to annul his conditional vow, status. Needless to say that ostracising oneself from the Jewish community even conditionally is forbidden, and we have a tradition that the bones inside Yehudah’s coffin were rattling for the entire 40 years the Jewish people carried the coffins of the 12 founding leaders of the tribes with them through the desert. This stopped only at the request of Moses who asked mercy for Yehudah in his final blessing in Deuteronomy 33,7, וזאת 'ליהודה וגו",

    "en": "<b>I am weary with my groaning; Every night make I my bed to swim; I melt my couch with my tears.</b> – For I groan and am anxious on account of my sickness and weep until I make my bed swim every night, because at night the sickness is grievous, and a man laments and weeps on account of his sickness. Or he weeps at night because the household is asleep and no one sees him. And lo ! he is weary with groaning and with weeping. And as for what he says: I make to swim and I water - it is by way of exaggeration and hyperbole. And the interpretation of אשחה (I make to swim) is (to be derived) from (such passages) as: \"as he that swimmeth (השחה) spreadeth out his hands to swim (לשׂחות)\" (Is. 25:11); or from the Targum (rendering) of \"and he washed (וירחץ)\" (Gen. 43:31), which is ואסתי. And the interpretation of אמסה (I melt) is (to be gathered) from (such passages) as: \" they made the heart of the people melt (המסיו)\" (Josh. 14:8); \"and like a moth Thou makest his beauty to melt away (ותמס)\" (Ps. 39:12). These (instances) are from verbs lamed he of the hifil conjugation. And there are many (cases) of double 'ayin verbs of this signification, as: \"They have made my heart to melt (הֵמַסּוּ)\" (Deut. 1:28); \"and the heart of the people melted (וַיִּמָּס)\" (Josh. 7:8).",
