        "After discussing leaven in a mixture, the Gemara states a more general principle. <b>Rabbi Abbahu said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: With regard to all prohibitions of the Torah, a permitted</b> substance <b>does not join together with a prohibited</b> substance. If one eats a permitted food with a prohibited food, and together they constitute the minimum prohibited measure, he is exempt from punishment for this act of consumption. This principle applies to all <i>halakhot</i> <b>except for the prohibitions of a nazirite,</b> who is liable for eating a mixture of that kind, <b>as the Torah said</b> with regard to a nazirite: “He shall abstain from wine and strong drink; he shall drink no vinegar of wine, or vinegar of strong drink, nor shall he drink anything <b>soaked</b> in grapes” (Numbers 6:3). This verse indicates that a nazirite is prohibited from consuming not only wine and vinegar, but also any food that was soaked in these liquids.",
        "<b>And Ze’eiri said:</b> Permitted and prohibited substances <b>also</b> combine with regard to <b>the prohibition against offering leaven</b> on the altar, as it states: “For no [<i>kol</i>] leaven and no [<i>kol</i>] honey shall be offered as a burnt-offering before the Lord” (Leviticus 2:11). This indicates that one is also liable for sacrificing leaven in a mixture (<i>Tosafot</i>) in addition to the liability for sacrificing pure leaven.",
        "The Gemara asks: <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion did Ze’eiri issue his ruling? It is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer, who derives</b> from the term <b><i>kol</i></b> that any mixture that contains any amount of a prohibited substance is not nullified.",

By noting that one is liable because permitted substances combine with prohibited substances, the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches us that an offering</b> of <b>less than an olive-bulk</b> is <b>not</b> considered an offering, and therefore sacrificing it is not punishable by lashes."

        "The Gemara returns to its discussion of Rabbi Abbahu’s statement with regard to the meaning of the word soaked in the verse: “He shall abstain from wine and strong drink; he shall drink no vinegar of wine, or vinegar of strong drink, nor shall he drink anything soaked in grapes,” and whether or not a permitted substance combines with a prohibited one. The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> does <b>this</b> word: <b>Soaked, come to</b> teach <b>that</b> mixtures are prohibited in this case?

        "comes <b>to establish</b> the principle that the legal status of the <b>taste</b> of a forbidden food is <b>like</b> that of its <b>substance.</b> This term teaches that any food that absorbs the taste of a prohibited item assumes the status of this prohibited item itself. <b>As,</b> in a case <b>where one soaked grapes in water and</b> the water <b>has the taste of wine,</b> a nazirite <b>is liable</b> for drinking this mixture, as it assumes the status of wine.",
        "<b>From here you derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard <b>to the entire Torah;</b> in all cases, the legal status of the taste of a forbidden food is like that of its substance. The Gemara elaborates. <b>Just as</b> with regard to <b>a nazirite, whose prohibition</b> against eating grapes <b>is not an eternal prohibition,</b> as he will be permitted to eat grapes once his period of naziriteship is over, <b>and</b> furthermore, <b>his prohibition is not a prohibition</b> against deriving <b>benefit</b> from wine, <b>and there is dissolution for his prohibition</b> against eating grape products by requesting a Sage to release him from his vow, nevertheless, in <b>his</b> case, the Torah <b>rendered</b> the legal status of the <b>taste</b> of food forbidden to him <b>like</b> that of its <b>substance;</b> with regard to a forbidden mixture of <b>diverse kinds, whose prohibition is an eternal prohibition [<i>issuro issur olam</i>] and whose prohibition is a prohibition</b> against deriving <b>benefit, and there is no dissolution for its prohibition, is it not right that</b> the Torah <b>should render</b> the legal status of the <b>taste</b> of its forbidden food <b>like</b> that of its <b>substance?</b>",
        "<b>And the same is true of fruit that grows on a tree during the first three years after it was planted [<i>orla</i>], on two</b> of three counts: Although the prohibition of <i>orla</i> is not an eternal prohibition, as one may eat the fruit of this tree after three years have passed, it is prohibited to derive benefit from <i>orla</i>, and this prohibition cannot be dissolved, as the fruits that grow during the first three years remain prohibited. Therefore, based on the same <i>a fortiori</i> inference, the principle: The legal status of its taste is like that of its substance, should apply in this case as well. Similarly, all other prohibitions in the Torah are more severe than the case of a nazirite in one of these aspects, and therefore this principle is universal. In any case, this entire derivation presents a difficulty for Rabbi Yoḥanan, who derives a different <i>halakha</i> from the term: Soaked.",
        "The Gemara answers: In accordance with <b>whose opinion</b> is the previously cited derivation? <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> who derive this <i>halakha</i> from the term: Soaked. However, <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan, who said</b> that a permitted substance joins together with a prohibited substance, holds <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva.</b>",
        "The Gemara asks: To <b>which</b> statement of <b>Rabbi Akiva</b> is the Gemara referring? <b>If you say</b> it is referring to the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva</b> in the following <b>mishna, as we learned: Rabbi Akiva says,</b> with regard to <b>a nazirite who soaked his bread in wine, and</b> the bread and the wine <b>contain</b> enough <b>to join together to</b> constitute <b>an olive-bulk,</b> that <b>he is liable; from where do we</b> know <b>that</b> Rabbi Akiva means an amount of an olive-bulk taken <b>from the bread and the wine</b> together? <b>Perhaps</b> he meant that the measure is calculated <b>from</b> the <b>wine alone?</b>",
        "The Gemara asks: <b>And lest you say</b> that if this amount is <b>from</b> the <b>wine alone, what</b> purpose is there <b>to state</b> this <i>halakha</i>, <b>this</b> statement comes to <b>teach us that even though</b> the prohibited item is <b>in a mixture,</b> one is nonetheless liable for consuming it. Since this mishna can be explained as referring to an olive-bulk from wine alone, it cannot be cited as proof for Rabbi Akiva’s opinion with regard to the combination of a permitted substance with a prohibited substance.",
        "The Gemara states: <b>Rather,</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan holds in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva in the <i>baraita</i>, as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Akiva says: A nazirite who soaked his bread in wine and ate an olive-bulk</b> of the mixture <b>from</b> the <b>bread and</b> the <b>wine is liable.</b> This <i>baraita</i> indicates that according to Rabbi Akiva, a permitted substance joins together with a prohibited substance.",
        "The Gemara asks: <b>And Rabbi Akiva, from where</b> does he derive the principle: The legal status of the <b>taste</b> is <b>like</b> that of the <b>substance</b> itself? The Gemara answers: <b>He derives</b> this principle from the prohibition of <b>meat</b> cooked <b>in milk.</b> In that case, there is <b>merely</b> the <b>taste</b> of the milk absorbed by the meat, <b>and</b> the mixture <b>is</b> nonetheless <b>forbidden. Here, too,</b> in the case of other prohibitions, it is <b>no different,</b> and the same principle applies.",
        "The Gemara asks: <b>And the Rabbis,</b> why don’t they derive this principle from meat cooked in milk? The Gemara answers: The Rabbis claim that <b>from meat in milk we do not derive</b> other prohibitions, <b>as</b> that prohibition <b>is a novelty.</b>",
        "The Gemara asks: <b>And what is</b> the <b>novelty</b> in that prohibition? <b>If you say that</b> it is unique in that <b>this</b> meat <b>alone and that</b> milk <b>alone</b> are each <b>permitted, and</b> yet <b>together they are forbidden,</b> that characteristic is not unique to meat cooked in milk. In the case of prohibited mixtures of <b>diverse kinds too, this</b> element <b>alone and that</b> element <b>alone</b> are each <b>permitted, and</b> yet <b>together they are prohibited.</b>",
        "The Gemara answers: <b>Rather,</b> the novelty is <b>that if one soaks</b> meat <b>in milk all day, it is permitted</b> by Torah law, despite the fact that the meat certainly absorbed some taste of the milk, whereas if <b>one cooked</b> the meat in milk even for a short time, the mixture <b>is prohibited</b> by Torah law.",
        "The Gemara asks: <b>And Rabbi Akiva too</b> certainly agrees that the <i>halakha</i> of <b>meat in milk is a novelty.</b> How can he derive a general principle from this case?",
        "<b>Rather, he derives</b> the principle: The legal status of the taste is like that of the substance itself <b>from</b> the required <b>purging</b> of the vessels of <b>gentiles.</b> In the section of the Torah that deals with the spoils of Midian (Numbers 31:21–24), it states that a vessel used by a gentile to cook food must be purged through fire and purified before it may be used by a Jew. <b>Isn’t</b> the <b>purging</b> of vessels of <b>gentiles</b> necessary only to cleanse them from the <b>mere taste</b> that was absorbed through the process of cooking? Even so, these vessels are <b>prohibited</b> if this cleansing was not performed. <b>Here, too,</b> it is <b>no different;</b> the same reasoning applies in all cases.",
        "The Gemara comments: <b>And the Rabbis</b> do not derive this principle from this source, as they maintain that the <i>halakha</i> of <b>purging</b> vessels of <b>gentiles is</b> also <b>a novelty.</b> What is the novelty of this <i>halakha</i>? <b>As</b> in general, <b>anything that contributes taste</b> that renders the food <b>tainted is permitted.</b> If the taste added by the prohibited food does not enhance the permitted food, then as a rule it does not render the permitted substance prohibited. <b>As we derive</b> this principle <b>from</b> the <i>halakha</i> that <b>an</b> unslaughtered <b>animal carcass</b> that is unfit for consumption is not classified as a prohibited animal carcass and is not prohibited. <b>However, here,</b> with regard to the <i>halakha</i> of purging vessels of gentiles, the Torah states that even if they contribute taste that renders the food tainted they are <b>prohibited.</b> If twenty-four hours have passed since food was cooked in a pot, the assumption is that it will contribute a negative taste to any foods cooked in the pot subsequently. Nevertheless, vessels taken from gentiles remain prohibited until they are purged, even though the taste they contribute taints the food.",
        "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how does <b>Rabbi Akiva,</b> who derives this principle from the required purging of the vessels of gentiles, respond to the previous claim? The Gemara explains: He holds <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion subsequently cited in the name of <b>Rav Ḥiyya, son of Rav Huna, who said: The Torah prohibited</b> unpurged vessels of gentiles <b>only in</b> the case of <b>a pot</b> that was used <b>on that day. Therefore, it is not</b> a case where the pot <b>contributes taste</b> that renders the food <b>tainted.</b>",
        "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> what do <b>the Rabbis</b> say about deriving the <i>halakha</i> from a pot used on that day? The Gemara answers: In their opinion, <b>even</b> in the case of <b>a pot</b> used <b>on that day, it is impossible that</b> the vessel <b>does not slightly taint</b> the food absorbed in the vessel. Consequently, the <i>halakha</i> of purging vessels of gentiles is indeed a novel case from which principles cannot be derived.",
        "<b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Avya, said to Rav Ashi: From</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, let us learn</b> the correct interpretation of the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva. Don’t the Rabbis say</b> that the term <b>soaked teaches</b> that the principle that the legal status of <b>taste is like</b> that of <b>substance</b> applies not only to a nazirite, but that <b>from here you derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard <b>to all prohibitions of the Torah? According to Rabbi Akiva as well,</b> the term <b>soaked teaches</b> that <b>the permitted</b> substance <b>joins together with the prohibited</b> substance with regard to a nazirite, and <b>from here you derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard <b>to all prohibitions of the Torah.</b> This explanation is contrary to the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan, who applies this principle only to a nazirite.",
        "Rav Ashi <b>said to him:</b> This cannot serve as a proof,"
      ],
      [
        "<b>due to</b> the fact that the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>a nazirite</b> and those of <b>a sin-offering</b> are <b>two verses that come as one,</b> i.e., to teach the same principle, and two verses that teach the same principle <b>do not teach</b> that principle by analogy.",
        "The Gemara elaborates: The derivation that a permitted substance joins together with a prohibited substance in the case of <b>a nazirite</b> is <b>that which we stated</b> above. With regard to <b>a sin-offering, what is</b> the derivation that permitted material combines with prohibited material? <b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: <b>“Anything that touches in its flesh shall become consecrated”</b> (Leviticus 6:20). I <b>might</b> have thought that non-sacred meat that touched any part of a sin-offering is rendered prohibited <b>even if it did not absorb</b> the taste of the sin-offering it touched. Therefore, <b>the verse states: In its flesh shall become consecrated,</b> to teach that this meat is not consecrated <b>until</b> the taste of the sin-offering <b>is absorbed within its flesh.</b>",
        "The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Shall become consecrated</b> means that <b>its</b> legal status <b>becomes like</b> that of the sin-offering itself; <b>that</b> is, <b>if</b> the sin-offering <b>is disqualified,</b> this meat <b>will</b> also <b>be disqualified. And if</b> the sin-offering <b>is valid,</b> the meat that touched it may <b>be eaten in accordance with the more stringent</b> standards <b>of</b> a sin-offering as far as when and where it may be eaten. The principle that a permitted substance joins together with a prohibited substance applies in the case of a sin-offering as well. Therefore, the principle cannot be extended to the entire Torah, as a <i>halakha</i> stated in two cases is not applied elsewhere.",
        "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> according to <b>the Rabbis as well, let</b> the cases of <b>a nazirite and a sin-offering</b> be considered <b>two verses that come as one and they do not teach</b> the principle that the legal status of taste is like that of the substance with regard to the entire Torah.",
        "The Gemara answers that the Rabbis <b>say:</b> Both of <b>these</b> cases <b>are necessary</b> as they could not have been derived from each other. Therefore, they are not two verses that come as one and it is possible to derive a principle from these two <i>halakhot</i>.",
        "The Gemara asks: <b>And Rabbi Akiva,</b> who does not derive a general principle from these verses, would respond by asking: In <b>what</b> way <b>are</b> they <b>necessary? Granted, if the Merciful One had written</b> this principle only with regard <b>to a sin-offering,</b> one would <b>not derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>a nazirite from it,</b> as <b>we do not derive</b> <i>halakhot</i> of <b>non-sacred</b> objects <b>from</b> those of <b>consecrated</b> objects. Certain stringencies and strictures apply only to consecrated property. <b>However, let the Merciful One write</b> this principle <b>with regard to a nazirite, and you</b> could <b>bring</b> the case of the <b>sin-offering and derive</b> it from the case of a nazirite, just <b>as</b> the application of this principle to <b>all prohibitions in the Torah is derived from</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>a nazirite.</b> Since this principle is stated in both cases unnecessarily, these are two verses that come as one, and one cannot derive a principle from them.",
        "The Gemara asks: <b>And the Rabbis,</b> as they maintain that the principle that the legal status of the taste of a prohibited substance is like that of the substance itself is not limited to these two cases, they would <b>say to you</b> that both sources <b>are necessary.</b> The case of the <b>sin-offering</b> is necessary <b>to</b> derive the principle <b>that a permitted</b> substance <b>joins together with a prohibited</b> substance, as <b>one cannot derive</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>non-sacred</b> food <b>from consecrated</b> property. <b>And</b> the term <b>soaked,</b> which appears in the context of the <i>halakhot</i> of a nazirite, <b>teaches</b> the principle that the legal status of <b>taste is like</b> that of the <b>substance.</b> Since both examples are necessary, they are not considered two verses that come as one, and it is therefore possible to derive a principle from them. <b>And</b> consequently <b>from here you derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard <b>to all of the Torah in its entirety.</b>",
        "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how could <b>Rabbi Akiva</b> respond to this claim? The Gemara answers: Rabbi Akiva would say that <b>both</b> cases teach the principle that <b>a permitted</b> substance <b>joins together with a prohibited</b> substance, <b>and they are</b> indeed <b>two verses that come as one,</b> to teach about the same issue. <b>And</b> the rule is that <b>any two verses that come as one do not teach</b> overarching principles.",
        "<b>Rav Ashi said to Rav Kahana: But</b> with regard to <b>that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse: “He shall eat <b>nothing that is made of the grapevine, from the grape skins to the grape seed”</b> (Numbers 6:4), <b>taught with regard to prohibitions of a nazirite that</b> these substances <b>join together.</b> If the nazirite ate only a small amount of each substance that when joined together constitute the measure that determines liability, he is liable. <b>Now</b> the following question arises: <b>According to Rabbi Akiva,</b> who maintains that <b>prohibited and permitted</b> substances <b>join together, is it necessary</b> to teach that one <b>prohibited</b> substance <b>joins together with</b> another <b>prohibited</b> substance? Apparently, according to Rabbi Akiva’s opinion, this derivation is unnecessary.",
        "Rav Kahana <b>said to him</b> that this derivation is necessary because the two cases are not identical: Whereas <b>prohibited and permitted</b> substances combine only when they are eaten <b>simultaneously, prohibited and</b> other <b>prohibited</b> substances join together even when eaten <b>one after the other.</b> In other words, if a nazirite eats half an olive-bulk of grape skins and then eats half an olive-bulk of grape seeds, he is liable according to Rabbi Akiva."

        "Apropos the issue of leaven taken by a rodent, the Gemara analyzes a series of similar cases. In a case where there were <b>nine piles of <i>matza</i> and one pile of leavened bread, and</b> one saw <b>a mouse come and take</b> a morsel from a pile, <b>and we do not know if it took <i>matza</i></b> or <b>if it took leavened bread, this is</b> akin to the case of <b>nine stores</b> in the mishna cited below. If a portion became <b>separated</b> from one of the piles and we did not know if it was <i>matza</i> or leaven, <b>and</b> one saw <b>a mouse come and take it, that is</b> akin to the case mentioned in <b>the latter clause</b> of that mishna.",
        "The Gemara elaborates. <b>As we learned</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>nine stores</b> in a city, <b>all of which sell</b> kosher <b>meat</b> from <b>a slaughtered</b> animal, <b>and one</b> other store that <b>sells meat</b> from unslaughtered <b>animal carcasses, and</b> a person <b>took</b> meat <b>from one of them and he does not know from which one he took</b> the meat, in this case of <b>uncertainty,</b> the meat <b>is prohibited.</b> This ruling is based on the principle: The legal status of an item fixed in its place is that of an uncertainty that is equally balanced. In this case, when it comes to determining whether or not this meat comes from a kosher store, the two types of stores are regarded as though they were equal in number.",
        "This <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And in</b> the case of meat <b>found</b> outside, <b>follow the majority.</b> If most stores in the city sell kosher meat one can assume that the meat he found is kosher, based on the principle: Any item separated, i.e., not fixed in its place, is presumed to have been separated from the majority. By the same token, if most stores in that city sell non-kosher meat, the meat found is presumed to be non-kosher. These two principles can be applied to the cases involving piles of <i>matza</i> and leaven: If the morsel was separated from the piles when taken by the mouse, follow the majority. However, if the mouse took the morsel from one of the piles, the legal status of the morsel is that of an equally balanced uncertainty concerning whether it was taken from a pile of <i>matza</i> or a pile of leaven, and the owner is required to conduct an additional search.",
        "The Gemara discusses another case: There are <b>two piles, one of <i>matza</i> and one of leavened bread, and before them</b> there are <b>two houses, one</b> which was <b>searched and one</b> which was <b>not searched, and two mice came,</b> and in our presence <b>one took <i>matza</i> and one took leavened bread.</b> Each mouse went into a different house, <b>and we do not know which</b> mouse <b>entered this</b> house <b>and which</b> mouse <b>entered that</b> house. It is unclear whether or not the mouse that took the leaven entered the house that was searched. <b>This</b> situation <b>is</b> akin to the case of <b>two baskets.</b>",
        "<b>As we learned</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i>: There are <b>two baskets, one</b> filled with <b>non-sacred</b> produce <b>and</b> the other <b>one</b> filled with <b><i>teruma</i>, and before them</b> are <b>two</b> vessels each containing a <b><i>se’a</i></b> of produce, <b>one</b> filled with <b>non-sacred</b> produce <b>and</b> the other <b>one</b> filled with <b><i>teruma</i>. And these,</b> the contents of each of the baskets, <b>fell into those,</b> each of the <i>se’a</i> vessels. It is possible that the <i>teruma</i> fell into the non-sacred produce, and it is prohibited for non-priests to eat a mixture of <i>teruma</i> and non-sacred produce. Nevertheless, the contents of the <i>se’a</i> vessel containing the non-sacred produce <b>is permitted, as I say</b> that <b>the non-sacred produce fell into the non-sacred produce and the <i>teruma</i> fell into the <i>teruma</i>.</b> Likewise, with regard to leaven, presumably the mouse took the leaven into the house that had not been searched, and there is no need to conduct an additional search of the house that was already searched.",
        "The Gemara rejects this comparison: <b>Say that we state</b> and apply the principle: <b>As I say,</b> and assume that everything occurred in a way that preserves the produce in its permitted state"
      ],
      [
        "only with regard <b>to <i>teruma</i></b> that in modern times is sacred <b>by rabbinic law,</b> as the Torah obligation to separate <i>teruma</i> was abrogated after the destruction of the First Temple. However, with regard <b>to leavened bread,</b> which is prohibited <b>by Torah law, do we say</b> that this principle applies? The Gemara responds: <b>Is that to say</b> that <b>the search for leavened bread</b> is required <b>by Torah law? It is</b> a <b>rabbinic</b> ordinance, <b>as by Torah law, mere nullification is sufficient.</b> Since the issue at hand is not the Torah prohibition of leaven but the rabbinic ordinance to search one’s house, this <i>halakha</i> is comparable to the case of baskets of <i>teruma</i> and non-sacred produce.",
        "The Gemara presents another situation: In a case where there is <b>one pile of leavened bread and before it</b> there are <b>two houses</b> that were <b>searched, and a mouse came and took</b> a morsel from the pile, <b>and we do not know if it entered this</b> house <b>or if it entered that</b> house, <b>this is</b> akin to the case of <b>two paths, as we learned</b> in a mishna: There were <b>two paths, one</b> of which was <b>ritually impure</b> due to a corpse buried there, <b>and one</b> of which was <b>ritually pure. And</b> someone <b>walked on one of them,</b> but he does not remember which, <b>and</b> afterward <b>he engaged in</b> handling items of <b>ritual purity,</b> e.g., <i>teruma</i> or consecrated items; <b>and another</b> person <b>came and walked on the second</b> path, and he too does not remember which path it was, <b>and he</b> also <b>engaged in</b> handling items of <b>ritual purity.</b>",
        "<b>Rabbi Yehuda says: If this</b> one <b>asked</b> a Sage <b>by himself, and that</b> one <b>asked</b> a Sage <b>by himself, they are</b> both <b>pure.</b> When considered separately, each person retains his presumptive status of ritual purity. However, if they <b>both</b> came to ask <b>at the same time, they are</b> both <b>ritually impure.</b> Since one of the two certainly passed on the impure path, even though it is uncertain which, both are deemed impure due to that uncertainty. <b>Rabbi Yosei says: One way or another they are</b> both <b>ritually impure.</b>",
        "<b>Rava said, and some say</b> it was <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> who said: If they came <b>at the same time, everyone agrees</b> that <b>they are ritually impure,</b> as even Rabbi Yehuda concedes that this is the <i>halakha</i>. If they came independently, <b>one after the other, everyone agrees</b> that <b>they are ritually pure. They disagree only with regard to</b> a case where one <b>comes to ask about himself and about the other. Rabbi Yosei likens this</b> case <b>to</b> one where they come to ask <b>at the same time, and Rabbi Yehuda likens it to</b> a case where they come <b>one after the other.</b>",
        "The Gemara addresses another case: If one saw a mouse take leaven and there is <b>uncertainty</b> whether the mouse <b>entered</b> a house that was already searched and <b>uncertainty</b> whether the mouse <b>did not enter</b> that house, <b>that is</b> akin to the <i>halakha</i> of ritual impurity in <b>a valley, and</b> is subject <b>to the dispute between Rabbi Eliezer and the Rabbis.</b>",
        "<b>As we learned</b> in a mishna with regard to <b>one who enters a valley during the rainy season,</b> when seeds are sprouting, people do not have permission to wander in the field of another, as they might harm the plants. For the purpose of this <i>halakha</i> a valley in the rainy season is considered a private domain, and there is a general principle that in the case of uncertainty concerning whether or not one contracted ritual impurity in a private domain he is ritually impure. <b>And if</b> there was <b>ritual impurity in a certain field, and one</b> person <b>said: I walked in that place,</b> in the valley, <b>and I do not know whether I entered that field or whether I did not enter, Rabbi Eliezer deems him pure, and the Rabbis deem him impure.</b>",
        "Rabbi Eliezer deems him pure, <b>as Rabbi Eliezer would say:</b> Concerning <b>uncertainty</b> with regard to <b>entry,</b> i.e., whether or not he entered the place, he is <b>ritually pure;</b> however, if one certainly entered the place and the <b>uncertainty</b> is with regard to <b>contact</b> with <b>ritual impurity,</b> he is <b>ritually impure.</b> According to this opinion, the principle with regard to uncertain impurity in the private domain applies only in a case where the uncertainty is with regard to contact. The Rabbis, however, do not distinguish between these situations, as they maintain he is impure regardless of whether the uncertainty is with regard to entry or with regard to contact. This dispute applies to the case of whether or not one is required to conduct an additional search for leaven in a case where there is uncertainty whether or not leaven was taken into the house.",
        "The Gemara discusses another case: If one saw a mouse <b>enter</b> a house with leaven in its mouth <b>and</b> someone <b>searched and did not find</b> any leaven there, this is akin to <b>the dispute between Rabbi Meir and the Rabbis. As we learned</b> in a mishna, <b>Rabbi Meir would say: Any object that has</b> the <b>presumptive status of ritual impurity,</b> i.e., it is certain that an impure object was buried in a particular place, that place <b>forever</b> remains <b>in its ritual impurity,</b> even if it was excavated and the source of impurity was not found, <b>until it becomes known to you where the ritual impurity is.</b> The assumption is that the impurity was not found because the search was not conducted properly.",
        "<b>And the Rabbis say</b> in this case: He continues <b>searching until he reaches bedrock or virgin soil,</b> under which there is certainly no ritual impurity. If he searched that extensively and failed to discover any impurity, it is apparently no longer there. This dispute applies to the aforementioned case involving leaven.",
        "The Gemara analyzes yet another case: If one saw a mouse <b>enter</b> a house with leaven in its mouth <b>and</b> one <b>searched and found</b> a morsel of leaven there, but there is uncertainty whether or not the morsel that he found is the morsel that the mouse took into the house, this would be akin to <b>the dispute between Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>and Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel.</b>",
        "<b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>a field in which a grave was lost,</b> i.e., there is certainly a grave located in the field but its precise location is unknown, <b>one who enters</b> the field <b>is ritually impure,</b> as he might have stepped on the grave. <b>If a grave was</b> later <b>found</b> and marked <b>in</b> the field, <b>one who enters</b> and walks on the other parts of the field <b>is ritually pure, as I say:</b> The <b>grave that was</b> previously <b>lost is</b> the <b>grave that was</b> subsequently <b>found.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: The entire field must be searched,</b> as perhaps the grave discovered is not the one that was lost. This dispute applies to the above case of leaven.",
        "The Gemara discusses another situation: If a person <b>placed nine</b> morsels of leaven <b>and found ten,</b> indicating that mice had added at least one morsel, this is akin to <b>the dispute between Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>and the Rabbis. As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to a person who <b>placed a <i>maneh</i>,</b> one hundred dinars, of second tithe, <b>and found two hundred</b> dinars: Since it is evident that someone came and placed at least one extra <i>maneh</i> there whose status is unclear, the pile is presumed to contain <b>non-sacred</b> money <b>and second-tithe</b> money <b>intermingled with each other.</b> The assumption is that the additional money is non-sacred, and it is impossible to determine which is the non-sacred money and which is the second-tithe money. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi.",
        "<b>And the Rabbis say:</b> It is <b>all non-sacred</b> money. Since someone else was clearly involved, it is possible that he took the <i>maneh</i> and left behind two hundred other dinars. Consequently, it is impossible to identify any of this money as the original <i>maneh</i>. This same reasoning can be applied to the case of leaven. Since there were undoubtedly mice present, it is possible that the mice took the morsels, moved them, and replaced them with other morsels. As a result, the entire house must be searched again.",
        "The Gemara raises the reverse situation. If one <b>placed ten</b> morsels <b>and found nine, this is</b> comparable to the case mentioned in <b>the latter clause</b> of that same <i>baraita</i>, <b>as it was taught</b> in the <i>baraita</i>: If one <b>left two hundred</b> dinars of second-tithe money <b>and found a <i>maneh</i>,</b> presumably, one <b><i>maneh</i></b> from the initial two hundred remains <b>placed, and</b> the other <b><i>maneh</i></b> is <b>taken</b> and missing. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi.",
        "<b>And the Rabbis say,</b> in keeping with their aforementioned opinion: It is <b>all non-sacred</b> money, as the assumption is that whoever took part of the money actually took it all, and this is a different <i>maneh</i>. Since it is different money, it is presumably non-sacred money, not second-tithe money. This dispute applies to the case where one finds fewer morsels of leaven than he left."

        "The Gemara addresses yet another case: If one <b>placed</b> leaven <b>in this corner and found</b> it <b>in another corner,</b> this is akin to <b>the dispute between Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel and the Rabbis, as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>an axe that was lost in a house, the house is impure, as I say</b> that <b>a ritually impure person entered</b> the house <b>and took</b> the axe, touching other items in the process. <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: The house is ritually pure, as I say</b> that <b>he lent</b> the axe <b>to another</b> person <b>and forgot, or that he took it from this corner and placed it in the other corner and forgot.</b>",

    "en": "בשנת שש מאות שנה לחיי נח, although Noach’s age had already been reported before, here the Torah adds further precise data about the month and the day of the month when the deluge commenced. בחודש השני, there is a disagreement between the scholars of the Talmud if the “second month” refers to a count based on the lunar year or the solar year. According to the view that the world was created in the month of Tishrey, (i.e. that Adam was created on the first of that moth), the month described here is the month of Marcheshvan, whereas according to the view that the universe was created in the month of Nissan, the deluge would have started in the month of Iyar. Rabbi Yonathan (Rosh Hashanah 11) decided that the correct version is that of Rabbi Eliezer who translated the verse בירח האתנים in Kings I 8,2 as the “ancient” month. It appears that this month was called איתנים, seeing it was the month (תשרי) in which the universe had been created. It was only after the Jewish people left Egypt, that they adopted the month of Nissan as the first month of their calendar year, (partially), as we know from Exodus 12,1-2. The verses there make sense only if the other nations had not used the month of Nissan as the first month of the calendar year.",
