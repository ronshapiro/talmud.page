        "§ Apropos the verse: “And he afflicted you and caused you to hunger, and fed you with manna” (Deuteronomy 8:3), the Gemara expounds related verses. The Torah states: <b>“Who feeds you manna in the desert</b> which your fathers did not know, <b>in order to afflict you”</b> (Deuteronomy 8:16). What affliction was there in eating the manna? <b>Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Asi</b> disagreed on the matter. <b>One said: There is no comparison between one who has bread in his basket and one who does not have bread in his basket.</b> The affliction in eating the manna lay in there being no leftover food for the next day. Each day the people worried that they might not have any food to eat the next day. <b>And one said: There is no comparison between one who sees</b> the food <b>and eats</b> it <b>and one who does not see</b> the food <b>and eats</b> it. Though the manna could taste like anything, it always looked the same and did not look as it tasted. Being unable to see the food that they tasted was an affliction.",
        "<b>Rav Yosef said: From here</b> there is an <b>allusion</b> to the idea <b>that blind</b> people <b>eat but are not</b> fully <b>satisfied</b> when they eat because they cannot see their food. Seeing the food contributes to the enjoyment of eating. <b>Abaye said: Therefore,</b> from what we have just learned, <b>one who has a meal should eat it only during daytime,</b> when there is light to see the food that is being eaten. <b>Rabbi Zeira said: What is the verse</b> that alludes to this? <b>“Better is the seeing of the eyes than the wandering of the desire”</b> (Ecclesiastes 6:9). On the same verse, <b>Reish Lakish said: The sight of a woman is better than the actual act</b> of relations, <b>as it is stated: “Better is the seeing of the eyes than the wandering of the desire.”</b>",
        "§ Apropos the dispute between Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Asi, the Gemara continues with another dispute they had with regard to the correct interpretation of a verse. It is stated: “Do not look upon the wine when it is red, <b>when it gives its color in the cup, when it glides down smoothly [<i>bemeisharim</i>]”</b> (Proverbs 23:31). <b>Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Asi</b> disagreed. <b>One said: Whoever casts</b>"
      ],
      [
        "<b>his eye on his cup,</b> i.e., is habitually drunk, all the prohibitions of <b>those with whom relations are forbidden seem to him like level [<i>mishor</i>]</b> ground. He is unaware of the pitfalls of sin and continues walking along a twisted and dangerous path. <b>And one said: Whoever casts his eye on his cup, the whole world seems to him like level [<i>mishor</i>] ground.</b> Not only is such a person unconcerned by forbidden sexual relations, but all other prohibitions, e.g., monetary prohibitions, also seem permitted in his eyes.",
        "§ The Gemara explains another verse in Proverbs: <b>“If there is care in a man’s heart, let him quash it [<i>yashḥena</i>]”</b> (Proverbs 12:25). <b>Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Asi</b> dispute the verse’s meaning. <b>One said: He should forcefully push it [<i>yasḥena</i>] out of his mind.</b> One who worries should banish his concerns from his thoughts. <b>And one said:</b> It means <b>he should tell [<i>yesiḥena</i>] others his</b> concerns, which will lower his anxiety.",
        "§ Another verse states: <b>“And dust shall be the serpent’s food”</b> (Isaiah 65:25). <b>Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Asi</b> dispute the verse’s meaning. <b>One said: Even if</b> the serpent <b>eats all the delicacies in the world, they will</b> still <b>taste like dust. And one said: Even if it eats all the delicacies in the world, its mind is unsettled until it</b> also <b>eats</b> some <b>dust.</b>",
        "With regard to the same topic, <b>it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yosei said: Come and see that the attribute of the Holy One, Blessed be He, is different than the attribute of flesh and blood. The attribute of flesh and blood</b> is that one who seeks to <b>provoke another harasses him</b> in all aspects of <b>his life, but the Holy One, Blessed be He, does not</b> act in <b>this</b> way. <b>He cursed the serpent</b> and what happened? When <b>the serpent goes up to the roof its food is with it,</b> and when <b>it comes down its food is with it.</b> Consequently, the curse that it suffers does not ruin its life but rather benefits it.",
        "Similarly, <b>He cursed Canaan</b> that he should be the servant of servants, but he benefits somewhat from this. <b>He eats what his master eats, and drinks what his master drinks,</b> and does not worry like a free man does. <b>He cursed the woman</b> and <b>everyone pursues her</b> to marry her. <b>He cursed the land</b> after the sin of Adam and Eve, yet <b>everyone is sustained from it.</b> Even when God is angry, He does not punish His creations severely."

        "§ Further on the topic of repentance, <b>Rabbi Ḥama bar Ḥanina said: Great is repentance, as it brings healing to the world, as it is stated: “I will heal their backsliding, I will love them freely”</b> (Hosea 14:5), which teaches that repentance from sin brings healing.",
        "<b>Rabbi Ḥama bar Ḥanina raised a contradiction</b> between two verses. <b>It is written</b> in one verse: <b>“Return, you backsliding children”</b> (Jeremiah 3:14), implying that <b>initially</b> when you sinned, it was only because <b>you were backsliding,</b> i.e., rebelling. It was merely an act of immaturity and foolishness and could be ignored as if it had never happened. <b>But it is written: “I will heal your backsliding”</b> (Jeremiah 3:22), implying that He will heal the sin from this point onward, and that they are still sinners. He resolved this contradiction, explaining that this is <b>not difficult: Here,</b> where everything is forgiven as if the Jewish people never sinned, it is referring to repentance <b>out of love; there,</b> where the sin is still remembered despite the forgiveness and repentance, it is referring to repentance <b>out of fear.</b>",
        "Similarly, <b>Rabbi Yehuda raised a contradiction</b> between two verses. <b>It is written: “Return, you backsliding children I will heal your backsliding”</b> (Jeremiah 3:22), implying that anyone can achieve healing, which is dependent only on repentance. But it also states: “Return, O backsliding children, says the Lord, <b>for I am a lord to you, and I will take you one from a city, and two from a family”</b> (Jeremiah 3:14), implying that repentance is available only to certain individuals. He resolved the contradiction and explained that this is <b>not difficult: Here,</b> it is referring to repentance <b>out of love or fear,</b> which few people achieve; <b>there,</b> it referring is repentance <b>through suffering,</b> as everyone has thoughts of repentance when they suffer. <b>Rabbi Levi said: Great is repentance, as it reaches the heavenly throne, as it is stated: “Return, Israel, to the Lord your God”</b> (Hosea 14:2). This implies that repentance literally reaches to God."
      ],
      [
        "§ <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Great is repentance, as</b> it <b>overrides</b> even <b>a prohibition of the Torah.</b> How so? <b>As it is stated</b> that God said: <b>“…Saying: If a man sends away his wife and she goes from him and becomes another man’s, may he return to her again? Will not that land be greatly polluted? But you have committed adultery with many lovers; and would you yet return to Me, said the Lord”</b> (Jeremiah 3:1). Indeed, the Torah states: “Her former husband, who sent her away, may not take her again to be his wife after she has been made impure” (Deuteronomy 24:4). The relationship between the Jewish people and the Holy One, Blessed be He, is compared to that between a husband and wife. Just as it is prohibited for an adulterous wife to return to her husband, it should be prohibited for the Jewish people to return to God from their sins, yet repentance overrides this prohibition.",
        "<b>Rabbi Yonatan said: Great is repentance, which hastens the redemption, as it is stated: “And a redeemer will come to Zion, and to those who repent from transgression in Jacob”</b> (Isaiah 59:20). <b>What is the reason</b> that <b>a redeemer will come to Zion?</b> It is <b>because</b> there are <b>those who repent from transgression in Jacob.</b>",
        "<b>Reish Lakish said: Great is repentance, as</b> the penitent’s <b>intentional sins are counted for him as unwitting transgressions, as it is stated: “Return, Israel, to the Lord your God, for you have stumbled in your iniquity”</b> (Hosea 14:2). The Gemara analyzes this: <b>Doesn’t “iniquity”</b> mean <b>an intentional sin? Yet</b> the prophet <b>calls it stumbling,</b> implying that one who repents is considered as though he only stumbled accidentally in his transgression. The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so? Didn’t Reish Lakish</b> himself <b>say: Great is repentance, as one’s intentional sins are counted for him as merits, as it is stated: “And when the wicked turns from his wickedness, and does that which is lawful and right, he shall live thereby”</b> (Ezekiel 33:19), and all his deeds, even his transgressions, will become praiseworthy? The Gemara reconciles: This is <b>not difficult: Here,</b> when one repents <b>out of love,</b> his sins become like merits; <b>there,</b> when one repents <b>out of fear,</b> his sins are counted as unwitting transgressions.",
        "<b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yonatan said: Great is repentance, which lengthens</b> the <b>years of a person’s</b> life, <b>as it is stated: “When the wicked man turns from his wickedness</b> that he has committed, and does that which is lawful and right, <b>he will preserve his life”</b> (Ezekiel 18:27).",
        "§ <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak said: They say in the West,</b> Eretz Yisrael, <b>in the name of Rabba bar Mari: Come and see that the attribute of flesh and blood is unlike the attribute of the Holy One, Blessed be He.</b> With <b>flesh and blood</b> people, if one <b>insults his friend with words, it is uncertain whether</b> the victim will <b>be appeased by him or</b> will <b>not be appeased by him. And if you say he will be appeased, it is</b> still <b>uncertain whether he</b> will <b>be appeased by words</b> alone <b>or</b> will <b>not be appeased by words</b> alone, and one must try to appease him in other ways.",
        "<b>But</b> with regard to <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He,</b> if <b>a person commits a transgression in private,</b> God <b>is appeased by words, as it is stated: “Take with you words and return to God”</b> (Hosea 14:3). <b>And not only that, but</b> God <b>considers it</b> as though he has done <b>a favor</b> for God by repenting, <b>as it is stated: “Accept that which is good”</b> (Hosea 14:3). <b>And not only that, but the verse ascribes him</b> credit <b>as though he had sacrificed bulls, as it is stated: “So we will render for bulls the offering of our lips”</b> (Hosea 14:3). <b>Lest you say</b> he is considered only like one who offers <b>obligatory bulls,</b> therefore <b>the verse states: “I will heal their backsliding, I will love them freely”</b> (Hosea 14:5). Repentance is considered as though it were the sacrifice of a free-will offering.",
        "<b>It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Meir would say: Great is repentance because the entire world is forgiven on account of</b> one <b>individual who repents, as it is stated: “I will heal their backsliding, I will love them freely; for My anger has turned away from him”</b> (Hosea 14:5). <b>It does not say: From them,</b> i.e., from the sinners, <b>but “from him,”</b> i.e., from that individual.
