      "<strong>HALAKHAH:</strong> When does one start to read the <i>Shema</i> in the evening?. We have stated<sup>7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">תני is the translation of <i>Targum Yerushalmi</i> for Hebrew הגד “to tell formally”. It is a technical term that implies a statement of Tannaïm, the teachers of the oral law who were active from Maccabean times to the death of Rebbi Yehudah the Prince, the compiler of the Mishnah. The insistence on this being taught, or formulated, repeatedly, shows that a statement introduced by תני is a formal statement, carefully formulated for oral repetition, and not just an <i>ad hoc</i> statement in a discussion. The vocalization תַּנִּי is the prevalent one in the Yerushalmi <i>Targumim</i>.</i>: “From the time that the priests enter to eat their <i>Terumah</i>”. Rebbi Ḥiyya stated<sup>8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rebbi Ḥiyya is R. Ḥiyya bar Abba bar Aḥa Karsala from Kufra in Babylonia, the greatest of the students and colleagues of Rebbi (Yehuda, the editor of the Mishnah). Rebbi Ḥiyya is credited with collecting the tannaitic material that Rebbi left out of the Mishnah. The collection known as the <i>Tosephta</i> is probably based on his material even though in the current form it is a Babylonian rearrangement. Now the Tosephta (<i>Berakhot</i> I,<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Tosefta Berakhot (Lieberman) 1\" href=\"/Tosefta_Berakhot_(Lieberman).1\">1</a>) is quoted in the <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Berakhot 2b\" href=\"/Berakhot.2b\">Babli (<i>Berakhot</i> 2b</a>):מאימתי מתחילין לקרוֹת קרית שמע בערבית משעה שבני אדם נכנסין לאכוֹל פתן בערבי שבתוֹת דברי רבי מאיר וחכמים אוֹמרים משעה שהכהנים זכאין לאכוֹל בתרוּמתן. “When may one start to read the <i>Shema</i> in the evening? From the time that people enter to eat their meals on Friday Evening, says Rebbi Meïr, but the Sages say from the moment that the Cohanim are allowed to eat their <i>Terumah</i>.” It seems that the Talmud does not indicate that R. Ḥiyya is reported here to quote the Tosephta but that there was a difference of opinion between Rebbi and Rebbi Ḥiyya about which opinion of those mentioned in the Tosephta should be accepted in the Mishnah as authoritative.<br>There is a fundamental disagreement between the two Talmudim in the interpretation of R. Meïr’s opinion. The Babli quotes a second version of R. Meïr, “from the time that the Cohanim immerse themselves in order to eat <i>Terumah</i>.” Since the Cohanim have to concentrate on their status of purity between immersion and eating, in order not to touch unclean matter inadvertently, it is clear that they will immerse themselves at or shortly after sunset, when it is still clearly day and no stars are visible, and start to eat at the earliest moment which can be declared to be night. Hence, the other version of R. Meïr, that people start to eat Friday nights, must also mean an early time. Since people return from work early on Fridays, being notified of the approching Sabbath by the sounding of trumpets (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Shabbat 35b\" href=\"/Shabbat.35b\">Babli <i>Šabbat</i>35b</a>), they will eat early. In particular in Babylonia, where synagogues were out in the fields, Friday evening services were held so that people could return to town before the unlit roads became completely dark. In Israel, on the other hand, synagogues were in towns and often the sermon was held on Friday evening. It is told in <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Vayikra Rabbah 9:9\" href=\"/Vayikra_Rabbah.9.9\"><i>Lev. rabba</i> 9(9</a>) that R. Meïr was preaching Friday evenings and even women came to hear the sermon at that time. Hence, the Sabbath meal was late. In Israel, R. Meïr’s pronouncement was taken to indicate a very late time.</i>: “From the time that people enter their houses Friday evening to eat their meal.” We have stated: “Their opinions are almost identical.” Come and see: “From the time that the priests enter to eat their <i>Terumah</i>” is still daylight and the stars start to appear<sup>9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As noted in the preceding comment, the Cohanim start to eat when it is no longer day, but before it is completely dark. The exact definition of “day,” “twilight,” “night” will be given later in the present section.</i>, “from the time that people enter their houses Friday evening to eat their meal” is one or two hours into the night. You want to say that the two opinions are almost identical? Rebbi Yose<sup>10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This R. Yose is the late Galilean Amora R. Yose (probably, ben Zabida), not the Tanna R. Yose ben Ḥalaphta.</i> said: Explain it by people in hamlets who usually leave the roads when there still is some daylight because they are afraid of wild beasts.",
      "It was stated: “He who recites (the <i>Shema‘</i>) before that time did not fulfill his duty.” If that is so, why does one recite (the <i>Shema‘</i>) in the synagogue? Rebbi Yose said: one does not recite it to fulfill one’s duty but only to stand in prayer after the study of Torah<sup>11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This section is quoted by Rashi in his commentary of the Mishnah in the Babylonian Talmud. The old Ashkenazic ritual that has preserved the Israeli usages, in contrast to the Sephardic rituals coming from Babylonia, requires that afternoon and evening prayers be said consecutively in the synagogue any time after מִנְחָה קְטַנָּה, 5/4 hours before sundown (the hour computed as 1/12th of daylight hours.) Hence, evening prayers with <i>Shema‘</i> are recited in full daylight. R. Yose declares that after nightfall everybody has to recite the <i>Shema‘</i> for himself (without benedictions) to fulfill the duty of reciting the <i>Shema‘</i> at its proper time. In contrast to <i>Shema‘</i>, the daily prayers are not bound rigidly to their times, as will be explained later in the Talmud.</i>.",
      "Rebbi Zeïra<sup>12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rebbi Zeïra was a Babylonian who appears in the Babylonian Talmud as Rebbi Zera; he rose to be head of the Yeshivah of Tiberias after Rebbi Yoḥanan.</i> in the name of Rav Jeremiah<sup>13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rav Jeremiah appears in the Babylonian Talmud as Rav Jeremiah bar Abba, one of the outstanding students of Rav. He should not be identified with Rebbi Jeremiah, a Babylonian and student of Rebbi Zeïra in Galilee.</i>: One who is in doubt whether he said Grace after his meal or not, must say Grace, since it is written (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Deuteronomy 8:10\" href=\"/Deuteronomy.8.10\"><i>Deut.</i> 8:10</a>): “You will eat and be satiated, then you must praise the Eternal<sup>14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">There is a problem how the Divine Name YHWH should be translated. The traditional “Lord”, taken from the Septuagint, is a translation not of the Name but of its substitute <i>ădōnāi</i>. The vocalization of the Name is unknown. The root is certainly הוה “to exist”. The form of the name indicates either <i>qal</i> or <i>pi‘el</i>, with a meaning “Eternal” or a <i>hif‘il</i>, meaning “Creator”. Probably it means both but for purposes of translation it is convenient to follow Mendelssohn and use the first meaning. [The so-called “scholarly” <i>hif‘il</i> vocalization, <i>yahweh</i>“Creator,” is certainly false since theophorous names show that the first syllable is vocalized either <i>yā, yô,</i> or <i>yĕ</i>, never <i>yah</i>, and, hence, as is to be expected, the Name does not follow any normative grammatical rule.]</i>, your God<sup>15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The verse quoted shows that saying Grace is a Biblical obligation (at least for people who ate to be satiated). For Biblical obligations, we always follow the rule that in doubt one has to follow the most stringent alternative.</i>”. One who who is in doubt whether he prayed or not, may not pray, against the opinion of Rebbi Yoḥanan<sup>16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rebbi Yoḥanan is the greatest authority among the Galilean Amoraïm of the second generation. It is rare to have a decision of later generations going against him.</i> who said: If only one would pray the whole day long, why? Because prayer is never in vain<sup>17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Everybody agrees that praying the <i>Amidah</i> three times a day is a rabbinic obligation. The majority opinion, reported here by R. Zeïra and anonymously in <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Berakhot 21a\" href=\"/Berakhot.21a\"><i>Babli Berakhot</i> 21a</a>, is that one may not recite this prayer more than three times a day (at least on weekdays) and that, therefore, when in doubt one may not pray since rabbinic ordinances are interpreted leniently in case of doubt. The contrary opinion of Rebbi Yoḥanan is also reported in the Babylonian Talmud (<i>loc. cit.</i>) but without the argument that prayer is never in vain. Rav Haï Gaon (<i>Otzar HaGeonim Berakhot</i>, Responsa p. 50, Commentaries p. 26) explains that Rebbi Yoḥanan thinks that prayer, as a supplication for Divine grace and in imitation of sacrifices, can be offered as fulfillment of a vow. It follows that, in his opinion, anyone who is in doubt whether he prayed already, should declare that his prayer should be counted as obligatory if he did not pray but as a voluntary offering if he already had fulfilled his obligation. This opinion is not acceptable to the Yerushalmi; since prayer is never in vain it does not need a prior declaration. There is a practical difference between the two Talmudim since according to Rav Haï’s interpretation, someone who started praying and remembered in the middle that he already had prayed, must stop in the middle even according to Rebbi Yoḥanan, but in the Jerusalem Talmud R. Yoḥanan is explicitly on record (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Berakhot 4:3:2-4:5\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Berakhot.4.3.2-4.5\"><i>Halakhah</i> 4:3</a>) that he goes on praying since prayer is never in vain.</i>! About one who is in doubt whether he recited (the <i>Shema‘</i>) or not we may hear from this: He who recites (the <i>Shema‘</i>) before that time did not fulfill his duty. And before that time is it not doubtful<sup>18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Later it will be discussed that sometime between sundown and nightfall there is a time of twilight when it is doubtful whether it belongs to day or night. Hence, someone who recites the <i>Shema‘</i> during twilight cannot be said to certainly have violated the rule that the evening <i>Shema‘</i> must be recited in the night and his case is equivalent to the one where the person is not sure whether he had recited the <i>Shema‘</i> already during the current evening.</i>? This means that one who is in doubt whether he recited (the <i>Shema</i>) or not must recite again<sup>19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since the Talmud has to prove indirectly that in reading the <i>Shema‘</i> one is stringent in case of doubt it seems that it is implied that the reading of <i>Shema‘</i> is a rabbinic institution (though it might leave in doubt the status of the first sentence or the first section.)</i>.",
      "A sign for it (nightfall) is after stars have become visible<sup>20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is an extended quote from a parallel to the <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Tosefta Berakhot (Lieberman) 1:1\" href=\"/Tosefta_Berakhot_(Lieberman).1.1\">Tosephta (1:1</a>) quoted in note 8. It is not from our Tosephta since the last sentence is missing there and the first sentence reads in the Tosephta, and in the Babylonian Talmud (2b), סימן לדבר צאת הכוֹכבים. Levi Ginzberg already has pointed out that the Biblical noun construction צאת הכוֹכבים “the emergence of stars” is never used in the Yerushalmi which prefers the verbal form. “It” referred to in this quote must be nightfall, the common time both for the criterion of R. Meïr and that of the Sages (Note 8).</i>. And though there is no proof, at least there is a hint<sup>21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This expression is found also in Yerushalmi <i>Sheviït</i> 9:2 (38d), <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Pesachim 1:1:2-17\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Pesachim.1.1.2-17\"><i>Pesaḥim</i>1:1</a> (27a), <i>Moëd Qaṭan</i> 1:4 (80c), <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Yevamot 4:11:2-10\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Yevamot.4.11.2-10\"><i>Yebamot</i> 4:11</a> (6a), <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Jerusalem Talmud Niddah 1:3:2-8\" href=\"/Jerusalem_Talmud_Niddah.1.3.2-8\"><i>Niddah</i> 1:4</a> (49a).</i> in (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Nehemiah 4:15\" href=\"/Nehemiah.4.15\"><i>Neh.</i> 4:15</a>): “We wereworking; half of them were holding spears, from the beginning of dawn to the visibility of stars.” And it is written (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Nehemiah 4:16\" href=\"/Nehemiah.4.16\"><i>v.</i> 16</a>): “The night was for us for watch duty and daytime for work.<sup>22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The argument goes as follows: Nehemiah’s people worked from dawn to dusk (in contrast to hired workers who labor from sunrise to sunset; <i>Baba meẓia‘</i> 7:1). The second verse, missing in the Tosephta, contains the proof: Neḥemiah declares that “day was for work” and, since he had defined his working day as dawn to dusk in the preceding verse, his definition at least for “day” is “dawn to dusk”. This is only a “hint”, not a proof, since his working day was irregular.</i>”",
      "How many stars have to appear that it should be night? Rebbi Phineas<sup>23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">R. Pinḥas Hacohen bar Ḥama, an Israeli Amora of the fourth generation. His source R. Abba bar Pappus was a Babylonian of the second Amora generation immigrating into Galilee. In the <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Shabbat 35b\" href=\"/Shabbat.35b\">Babli (<i>Šabbat</i> 35b</a>), the criterion of three stars is attributed to Samuel, one of the two foremost Babylonian authorities of the first generation. This criterion is originally Babylonian since the criterion of Cohanim eating their <i>Terumah</i> was never applicable in Babylonia.</i> in the name of Rebbi Abba bar Pappus: one star (visible) is certainly daylight. Two are doubtful as night. Three is certainly night. Are two doubtful? Is it not written (<a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Nehemiah 4:15\" href=\"/Nehemiah.4.15\"><i>Neh.</i> 4:15</a>): “To the visibility of stars?<sup>24</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The argument here is that Neḥemiah uses a plural in his definition of nightfall. So he talks about at least two stars. Now Talmudic interpretation of Scripture follows a principle that I have discussed repeatedly (“Logical Problems in Jewish Tradition” in: <i>Confrontations with Judaism</i>, ed. P. Longworth, London 1967, pp. 171–196; <i>Seder Olam</i>, North-vale NJ 1998, p. 6) that every Biblical statement must have a definite meaning. Since numbers do not have an upper bound, the only definite number indicated by a plural is 2. Hence, the plural must mean two unless it is accompanied by a description like “many”, etc. The description in the Babli is: תפסת מוּעט תפסת תפסת מרוּבה לא תפסת “If you grab the minimum you have something in your hand; if you grab more you have nothing in your hand.” It follows that Neḥemiah can talk only about two stars in his description of night.</i>” The minimum of “stars” are two! The first one does not count<sup>25</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since Venus often is visible in daylight, it cannot count in the determination of nightfall. Later it is stated that no star visible during daytime hours can be counted for the determination of nightfall. This naturally seems to eliminate the count of stars as a practical procedure.</i>.",
      "Friday night, if someone saw one star and did work (forbidden on the Sabbath), he is free from punishment. Two, he brings a trespass offering for a sin in doubt<sup>26</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The trespass offering described in <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Leviticus 5:17-19\" href=\"/Leviticus.5.17-19\"><i>Lev.</i> 5:17–19</a> for somebody who without premeditation commits an act of which he later has doubts whether it was sinful or not. By the preceding statement, at the time when exactly two stars are visible it is impossible to know whether it is day or not. The sin offering for sins committed in error is described <a class=\"refLink\" data-ref=\"Leviticus 4:27-35\" href=\"/Leviticus.4.27-35\"><i>Lev.</i> 4:27–35</a>.</i>. Three, he brings a sin offering. Saturday night, if someone saw one star and did (forbidden) work, he brings a sin offering. Two, he brings a trespass offering for a sin in doubt. Three, he is free from punishment."
