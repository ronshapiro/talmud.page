    "en": "The mishna continues enumerating those liable to receive lashes: <b>A ritually impure person who ate sacrificial</b> food <b>and one who entered the Temple</b> while <b>ritually impure. And one</b> who <b>eats</b> the forbidden <b>fat</b> of a domesticated animal; <b>or blood; or <i>notar</i>,</b> leftover flesh from an offering after the time allotted for its consumption; <b>or <i>piggul</i>,</b> an offering invalidated due to intent to sprinkle its blood, burn its fats on the altar, or consume it, beyond its designated time; <b>or</b> one who partakes of an offering that became <b>impure,</b> is flogged. <b>And one who slaughters</b> a sacrificial animal <b>or sacrifices</b> it on an altar <b>outside</b> the Temple courtyard, <b>and one who eats leavened bread on Passover, and one who eats</b> on Yom Kippur <b>and one who performs labor on Yom Kippur, and one who blends the</b> anointing <b>oil</b> for non-sacred use, <b>and one who blends the incense</b> that was burned on the altar in the Sanctuary for non-sacred use, <b>and one who applies the anointing oil, and one who eats unslaughtered</b> animal or bird <b>carcasses, or <i>tereifot</i>,</b> which are animals or birds with a condition that will lead to their death within twelve months, or <b>repugnant creatures, or creeping animals,</b> is liable to receive lashes. If <b>one ate untithed produce,</b> i.e., produce from which <i>terumot</i> and tithes were not separated; <b>or first-tithe</b> produce <b>whose <i>teruma</i></b> of the tithe <b>was not taken; or second-tithe</b> produce <b>or sacrificial</b> food <b>that was not redeemed;</b> he is liable to receive lashes. With regard to the measure for liability for eating forbidden food, the mishna asks: <b>How much does one</b> need to <b>eat from untithed produce and be liable</b> to receive lashes? <b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> If one ate <b>any amount</b> of untithed produce he is liable to receive lashes. <b>And the Rabbis say:</b> He is liable only if he eats <b>an olive-bulk,</b> which is the minimum measure characterized as eating. <b>Rabbi Shimon said to them: Do you not concede to me with regard to one who eats an ant of any size that he is liable</b> to receive lashes? The Rabbis <b>said to</b> Rabbi Shimon: He receives lashes for eating an ant of any size <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that it is</b> an intact entity in the form <b>of its creation,</b> and that is what the Torah prohibited. Rabbi Shimon <b>said to them: One</b> kernel of <b>wheat</b> is <b>also</b> in the form <b>of its creation,</b> and therefore one should be liable to receive lashes for eating any intact entity.",
