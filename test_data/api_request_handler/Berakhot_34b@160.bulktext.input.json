        "<b>And Rabbi Yishmael maintains</b> that “the owner of the pit” means that <b>the one responsible for the hazard</b> is liable even if he dug the pit in the public domain and then renounced ownership of it. But one who digs a pit on his own property is not liable.",

The Gemara answers: It means that <b>this is the pit</b> with <b>which the verse initially introduces</b> the subject <b>of compensation</b> for damage caused. In that context, the Torah states: “The owner of the pit shall pay” (Exodus 21:34), indicating that even a pit owned on one’s private property renders one liable.",
        "<b>And Rav Yosef said</b> that one can explain the dispute between Rabbi Yishmael and Rabbi Akiva differently: <b>With regard to</b> one who dug <b>a pit on</b> his <b>private property</b> and then renounced ownership of the property aside from the pit, <b>everyone agrees that he is liable.

Although he does not own the area itself, he is liable for creating a public hazard.",
        "<b>And Rabbi Akiva,</b> by contrast, holds that one is liable only in the case of a pit located on private property, where he renounced ownership of the property aside from the pit, and one cannot derive otherwise from any extraneous phrases. This is because <b>these</b> phrases <b>are necessary, for if the Merciful One wrote</b> only: <b>“If</b> a man <b>shall open</b> a pit” (Exodus 21:33), <b>I would say</b> that <b>it is</b> specifically when <b>one opens</b> the covering of a pit that has already been dug <b>that it is sufficient for him to</b> place <b>a covering</b> on it to absolve himself of responsibility for damage it causes. This is the case where the Torah states: “And not cover it” (Exodus 21:33). But if one actually <b>digs</b> a pit, it <b>would not be sufficient</b> to place <b>a covering</b> on it, and one would not be exempt from damages <b>unless he</b> completely <b>packs it.</b>",
        "<b>And</b> conversely, <b>if the Merciful One had written</b> only: <b>“If</b> a man <b>shall dig,” I would say</b> that <b>it is</b> specifically in a case of <b>digging that a covering is required</b> to exempt one from liability, <b>because he performed an action</b> of creating the pit. <b>But</b> for merely <b>opening</b> it, <b>where one has not performed an action, say</b> that he <b>does not require a covering</b> to absolve him of liability. Therefore, the Torah <b>teaches us</b> that he is liable for damage caused by a pit in both cases, and one should interpret the verse that states: “The owner of the pit” (Exodus 21:34), in its plain sense, i.e., that he is the owner of the pit because it is located on his private property. Accordingly, one would not be liable for a pit dug in the public domain.",

The Gemara answers: It means that <b>this is the pit</b> with <b>which the verse initially introduces</b> the subject <b>of damage</b> caused by Pit, as explained by Rabbi Yishmael above. Only afterward does it state: “The owner of the pit shall pay,” referring to a pit dug on one’s own property.",
        "The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who digs a pit</b> whose hollow space is <b>in the public domain and</b> then <b>opens its</b> entrance <b>into private property</b> is <b>exempt, and</b> this is the <i>halakha</i> <b>even though he does not have permission to do so.</b> The reason he does not have permission to do so is <b>that one may not create a hollow</b> space <b>under the public domain.</b>",

        "The Gemara infers: <b>The reason</b> for the exemption is that one digs <b>for</b> the purpose of <b>foundations,</b> which is the usual and accepted practice, <b>but</b> if he did <b>not</b> dig <b>for</b> the purpose of <b>foundations,</b> he is <b>liable.</b> Although he did so on his own property, he is nevertheless liable, since people walk there.",
        "The Gemara clarifies: In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> <i>baraita</i>? <b>Granted, according to Rabba, the first clause,</b> where one is seemingly exempt for opening a pit onto private property even if he subsequently renounced ownership of the area, can be established in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael, and the last clause</b> can be established in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva,</b> who maintains that one is liable for a pit dug on his own property if it is open to public traffic.",

        "The Gemara answers that <b>Rav Yosef</b> could have <b>said to you: Everyone agrees</b> with the <b>entire</b> passage. As for <b>the first clause,</b> which exempts one who digs a pit under the public domain and opens it onto his own property, it is referring to a case <b>where one did not renounce ownership of either his property or his pit.</b> This certainly is not included in the category of Pit with regard to damages, and the owner is therefore exempt.",
        "<b>Rav Ashi said: Now that you have interpreted Rav Yosef’s</b> explanation of the <i>baraita</i> as being <b>in accordance with all</b> opinions, then <b>also according to Rabba,</b> you are <b>not</b> required to <b>establish it as</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>.</b>",
        "Rather, one can say that <b>since the first clause</b> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael,</b> who exempts one who renounces ownership of his property but not the pit, <b>the last clause</b> can <b>also</b> be explained in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael. And</b> it was previously inferred that <b>the reason</b> for the exemption when digging on one’s private property adjacent to the public domain is that one digs <b>to</b> lay <b>foundations. But</b> if it is <b>not to</b> lay <b>foundations,</b> one is <b>liable. For instance,</b> in a case <b>where one widened</b> the pit unnecessarily, extending it <b>into the public domain,</b> he has effectively dug a pit in the public domain itself.",
        "The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: One <b>who digs a pit on private property and opens it into the public domain</b> is <b>liable.</b> But if he dug it <b>on private property that was adjacent to the public domain,</b> he is <b>exempt.

        "<b>But if we hold</b> that one who digs <b>a pit on his</b> own <b>property</b> and then declares the property, but not the pit, ownerless, is <b>exempt</b> from liability for damage caused, <b>how can you find</b> a case of a pit <b>for which</b> a person is <b>liable?</b> It can only be a case where it is located <b>in the public domain, and how can you find</b> a case of a <b>pit belonging to two partners in the public domain?</b>",
        "<b>If they both</b> jointly <b>appointed an agent and said to him: Go dig</b> a pit <b>for us, and he went</b> and <b>dug</b> a pit <b>for</b> both of <b>them,</b> then neither is liable.

Therefore, this is also not treated as a jointly owned pit.",
        "The Gemara notes: <b>This works out well according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>and you find in</b> a case of <b>damage</b> that both would be liable, as the Gemara will soon explain. Therefore, it qualifies as a case of a pit belonging to two partners. <b>But according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, the first partner is not held liable at all in a case <b>where</b> the pit causes an animal’s <b>death; and according to</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> the first partner is not held liable both in a situation <b>where it causes death and</b> in a situation where it merely causes <b>damage.</b> If so, <b>how, can you find</b> an instance of a pit belonging to partners?",
        "<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> This is referring to a case <b>where they both extracted a chunk</b> of earth from the bottom of the pit <b>simultaneously, and</b> thereby <b>completed</b> it <b>to</b> a depth of <b>ten</b> handbreadths. This, then, would constitute a pit belonging to both of them.",
        "Having mentioned the dispute between Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi and the Rabbis, the Gemara inquires: <b>What</b> is the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>and what</b> is the opinion of <b>the Rabbis? As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>one who digs a pit nine</b> handbreadths deep, <b>and another</b> person <b>came and completed</b> the digging <b>to</b> a depth of <b>ten</b> handbreadths, <b>the latter</b> individual alone is <b>liable</b> for an injury or death caused by the pit. <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> One <b>follows the latter</b> for restitution <b>for death</b> caused by the pit. The latter is solely liable, since only a pit of ten handbreadths renders a person liable for an animal’s death. <b>And</b> one <b>follows both of them</b> for restitution <b>for damage</b> caused by the pit.",
        "The Gemara explains: <b>What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of the Rabbis? As the verse states: “If</b> a man <b>shall open</b> a pit, <b>or if</b> a man <b>shall dig</b> a pit” (Exodus 21:33), it raises the question: <b>If</b> he is <b>liable for opening</b> a covered pit that has already been dug, then is it <b>not all the more so</b> that he should be liable <b>for digging</b> a new pit? What, then, does that latter phrase add? <b>Rather,</b> the verse serves <b>to include</b> the case of one person who begins to <b>dig</b> a pit and <b>after</b> he does so, a second person continues to <b>dig.</b> By subsequently stating: “If a man shall dig a pit,” the Torah teaches <b>that</b> a new pit is effectively created by the second digger, whose digging <b>removed,</b> i.e., rendered irrelevant, <b>the action of the first</b> digger and who bears full responsibility for the pit.",
        "<b>And Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi could have <b>said to you: These</b> two clauses in the verse <b>are</b> both <b>necessary,</b> and the second clause cannot serve to teach the <i>halakha</i> of the sole liability of the second digger. The reason they are necessary is <b>as we said</b> earlier (50a), where interpretations were cited according to both Rabbi Yishmael and Rabbi Akiva. The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> don’t <b>the Rabbis also</b> agree that they <b>are necessary</b> for those interpretations? If so, what is the source of their opinion that responsibility for the pit rests solely with the second partner?",
        "<b>Rather,</b> the previous explanation must be rejected, and <b>this is the reason of the Rabbis:</b> The <b>verse states: “If a man shall dig a pit,”</b> indicating that <b>one</b> person is liable, <b>but not two.</b> Therefore, if two people jointly created the pit, the second bears responsibility and not the first.",
        "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how does <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi understand the phrase “if a man shall dig a pit”? The Gemara answers: <b>He requires that</b> phrase to teach another <i>halakha</i>. The phrase <b>“if a man shall dig a pit”</b> indicates that a person who digs a pit is liable, <b>but</b> one is <b>not</b> liable if his <b>ox</b> digs a <b>pit.</b>",
        "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> from where do <b>the Rabbis</b> derive this <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara answers that the combination of words: <b>Man</b> and <b>pit,</b> is <b>written twice:</b> “If a man shall open a pit, or if a man shall dig a pit.” From one phrase, the <i>halakha</i> is derived that a person must do the digging, and not an animal. From the second phrase, the <i>halakha</i> is derived that one person bears responsibility for the damage, and not two people.",
        "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> what does <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi derive from this repetition? The Gemara answers: In his opinion, <b>since</b> the Torah <b>wrote this</b> first clause using this wording, it similarly <b>wrote this</b> second clause in the same fashion. The repetition is for stylistic reasons, and is not meant to teach a new <i>halakha</i>.",
        "The Gemara continues to ask about the opinion of the Rabbis: <b>And</b> even if they derive from the verse that only one person is liable for damage caused through the pit, <b>from where</b> do they know <b>that</b> the Torah intends <b>to render</b> specifically <b>the latter one liable</b> for the damage? <b>Perhaps</b> it is <b>to render the first one</b> who started the digging <b>liable</b> for the damage.",
        "The Gemara answers: It should <b>not enter your mind</b> to suggest this, <b>since the verse states: “And the carcass shall be for him”</b> (Exodus 21:34). This indicates that it is <b>the one who causes the death,</b> i.e., the second one, who is liable, and not the first. This is because it is the second one who completed digging the necessary depth for causing death, and not the first.",
        "The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> isn’t <b>this</b> clause: <b>“And the carcass shall be for him,” necessary for that which Rava</b> states? <b>As Rava says:</b> With regard to <b>a disqualified consecrated ox that fell into a pit,</b> the pit’s owner is <b>exempt, as it is stated: “And the carcass shall be for him.”</b> Evidently, the verse is stated <b>with regard to</b> a case <b>where the carcass belongs</b> to him. This ox, which was consecrated and subsequently disqualified, does not fully belong to anybody, since its use is restricted. Since this verse serves to teach Rava’s ruling, it cannot serve to teach about the liability of the second digger.",
        "The Sages <b>said</b> in response: <b>And can’t you learn from</b> the words and emphasis of the verse <b>by itself that we are dealing with the one who caused</b> the animal’s <b>death,</b> even if these words are also used to derive Rava’s ruling? Therefore, the verse can serve as a source for both rulings.",
        "On a similar subject, <b>the Sages taught:</b> In a case of <b>one who digs a pit</b> to a depth of <b>ten</b> handbreadths, <b>and another comes and completes</b> the depth <b>to twenty</b> handbreadths by digging an additional ten handbreadths, <b>and another comes and completes it to thirty,</b> they are <b>all liable</b> for any damage caused by this pit. The Gemara comments: <b>And</b> one can <b>raise a contradiction</b> against this from a <i>baraita</i>: In a case of <b>one who digs a pit</b> to a depth of <b>ten</b> handbreadths, <b>and another came and plastered</b> it <b>and cemented [<i>vekhiyyeid</i>]</b> it, <b>the latter</b> is <b>liable</b> for damage, and not the first."

        "<b>Rav Zevid said:</b> Both <b>this</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>and that</b> <i>baraita</i> are in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis.</b> The way the first <i>baraita</i> accords with their opinion is that <b>the Rabbis say</b> that <b>the last one</b> is <b>liable only where the first</b> one <b>did not make the</b> pit of sufficient <b>measurement</b> to cause <b>death,</b> but dug less than ten handbreadths. <b>But where the first one made</b> a pit of sufficient <b>measurement</b> to cause <b>death,</b> such as in this case, where the first one dug ten handbreadths himself and it was subsequently deepened further by others, <b>even the Rabbis concede that they are all liable.</b>",
        "The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> in the second <i>baraita</i>, where <b>he plastered and cemented</b> it, <b>the first made</b> a pit of sufficient <b>measurement</b> to cause <b>death, and</b> nevertheless, the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches</b> that <b>the last person</b> is <b>liable.

        "<b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> that this is what <b>Rav Zevid said:</b> Both <b>this</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>and that</b> <i>baraita</i> are in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. <b>This</b> first <i>baraita</i>, <b>which teaches: They are all liable,</b> fits <b>well</b> with his opinion. <b>That</b> second <i>baraita</i>, <b>which teaches: The last one</b> alone is <b>liable,</b> is referring to a case <b>where</b> the pit <b>did not have</b> sufficient <b>fumes in it</b> that were capable of leading to <b>either death or damage, and</b> then <b>another</b> person <b>came and</b> by narrowing it with plaster and cementing it, <b>he added to it</b> the characteristic of having <b>fumes</b> capable of leading <b>to both death and damage.</b>",
        "Elaborating on this subject, <b>Rava says:</b> With regard to one who <b>placed a stone at the opening of a pit</b> less than ten handbreadths deep <b>and brings</b> the pit <b>to</b> a depth of <b>ten</b> handbreadths by raising the ground next to the opening of the pit, <b>we have arrived at the dispute</b> between <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>and the Rabbis</b> concerning whether only the second or both are responsible for damage caused.",
        "The Gemara asks: <b>Isn’t</b> this <b>obvious?</b> This is precisely the case they are disputing, so what does Rava’s statement add to this? The Gemara answers: <b>Lest you say</b> that there is a distinction between a person deepening a pit <b>at the bottom,</b> in which case it <b>is his</b> lethal <b>fumes</b> that he caused <b>that kill</b> the animal, <b>but</b> if he added to the pit <b>at the top, where it is not his</b> lethal <b>fumes</b> that <b>kill</b> the animal, <b>say</b> that he would <b>not</b> be liable. Rava’s statement <b>teaches us</b> that the last one is liable, and this case is subject to dispute between Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi and the Rabbis as to whether only the last one or both are liable.",
        "<b>Rava raises</b> the following <b>dilemma:</b> If someone dug another handbreadth in a pit that was nine handbreadths deep, so that it reached a depth of ten handbreadths, and subsequently <b>closed up</b> that <b>handbreadth</b> inside the pit, <b>or</b> if <b>he removed his stones</b> that he had placed at the opening of the pit so that the depth of the pit was reduced to less than ten handbreadths, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Do we say that what he did</b> to increase the depth of the pit to ten handbreadths, <b>he has</b> removed, and restored the initial situation that existed before he dug the extra handbreadth, causing responsibility for damage to revert solely to the original digger?",
        "<b>Or perhaps,</b> by closing it up, he <b>removed the action of</b> the <b>first</b> digger, since he has removed the ability of the pit to cause death? If so, it <b>moves entirely into his possession</b> and he now assumes full responsibility for the pit of nine handbreadths. The Gemara concludes: The question <b>shall stand</b> unresolved."

        "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>a firstborn</b> animal <b>that was congested with</b> excess <b>blood,</b> and which can be healed only through bloodletting, <b>one may let</b> the animal’s <b>blood</b> by cutting it <b>in a place where</b> the incision <b>does not cause</b> a permanent <b>blemish. But one may not let</b> the animal’s <b>blood</b> by cutting it <b>in a place where</b> the incision <b>causes</b> a permanent <b>blemish,</b> as it is prohibited to intentionally cause a blemish in a firstborn animal; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b>",
        "<b>And the Rabbis say: One may even let</b> the animal’s blood by cutting it <b>in a place where</b> the incision <b>causes</b> a permanent <b>blemish, provided that he does not slaughter</b> the animal <b>on</b> the basis <b>of that blemish,</b> even though in general, a firstborn animal may be slaughtered once it develops any permanent blemish. <b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> The animal <b>may even be slaughtered on</b> the basis <b>of that blemish. Rabbi Yehuda says: Even</b> if the firstborn would <b>die</b> if its blood is not let, <b>one may not let its blood</b> at all.",
        "The Gemara relates: <b>Rabbi Elazar taught his son, and some say</b> it was <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya</b> who taught <b>his son:</b> Just <b>as</b> there is <b>a dispute here</b> in this <i>baraita</i> with regard to bloodletting, <b>so</b> there is <b>a dispute</b> in a mishna <b>with regard to a barrel of <i>teruma</i>. As we learned</b> (<i>Terumot</i> 8:8): In the case of <b>a barrel of <i>teruma</i></b> oil <b>with regard to which uncertainty developed</b> concerning its status of <b>ritual impurity,</b> and which therefore may not be eaten, <b>Rabbi Eliezer says</b> that one must nevertheless safeguard the <i>teruma</i> from impurity. Therefore, <b>if</b> the barrel <b>was resting in a vulnerable location,</b> where it might come into contact with impurity, one <b>should place it in a concealed location, and if it was exposed, he should cover it.</b>",
        "<b>Rabbi Yehoshua says:</b> That is not necessary. Rather, <b>if it was placed in a concealed location,</b> one <b>may place it in a vulnerable location. If it was covered he may expose it,</b> as he need no longer safeguard this <i>teruma</i> from impurity. <b>Rabban Gamliel says:</b> One <b>should do nothing new with it,</b> i.e., he should leave the barrel as it is.",
        "The Gemara clarifies: <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> who deems it permitted to let the firstborn offering’s blood provided that one does not cause a blemish, holds <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer,</b> who deems it prohibited to place the barrel in an exposed location lest it become ritually impure, which is equivalent to a blemish. <b>And the Rabbis,</b> who deem bloodletting permitted even if it will cause a blemish, hold <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehoshua,</b> who rules that the contents of the barrel may be exposed to ritual impurity. <b>And Rabbi Yehuda,</b> who says that bloodletting is not permitted under any circumstance, holds <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabban Gamliel,</b> who rules that the barrel should be left as is and not be handled at all.",
        "The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>From where</b> can one prove that these comparisons are accurate? <b>Perhaps Rabbi Meir states</b> his opinion, that one may not let blood in a place that will cause a blemish, <b>only there, as</b> the individual is <b>causing</b> the blemish <b>by</b> direct <b>action. But here,</b> in the case of the barrel, <b>where</b> the ritual impurity results <b>from an indirect</b> action, perhaps <b>he holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehoshua.</b>",
        "<b>And</b> furthermore, perhaps <b>Rabbi Eliezer states</b> his opinion that the barrel should be protected <b>only here,</b> because <b>perhaps Elijah will come and deem it ritually pure. But there,</b> with regard to the firstborn offering, <b>where if one leaves</b> the animal <b>it will</b> certainly <b>die,</b> perhaps <b>he holds in accordance with the</b> opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> that bloodletting is permitted in order to prevent the animal’s death.",
        "<b>And</b> likewise, <b>perhaps the Rabbis state</b> their opinion <b>only here,</b> with regard to the firstborn offering, <b>as if one leaves it,</b> the animal <b>will</b> certainly <b>die. But there,</b> in the case of the barrel of <i>teruma</i>, perhaps they accept the claim that one must safeguard the <i>teruma</i>, because <b>perhaps Elijah will come and deem it ritually pure,</b> which would mean that <b>they hold in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer.</b> It can also be suggested that <b>Rabbi Yehuda states</b> his opinion, that bloodletting is prohibited in all circumstances, <b>only here,</b> with regard to the firstborn offering, <b>as</b> the individual is <b>causing</b> the blemish <b>by</b> direct <b>action. But there,</b> in the case of the barrel, <b>where</b> the ritual impurity results from an <b>indirect</b> action, perhaps <b>he holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehoshua.</b>",
        "<b>And</b> perhaps <b>Rabban Gamliel states</b> his opinion, that the barrel should not be moved at all, <b>only there,</b> because <b>perhaps Elijah will come and deem it ritually pure. But here,</b> with regard to the firstborn offering, <b>where if one leaves it, it will</b> certainly <b>die,</b> it is possible that <b>he holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis.</b>",
        "<b>And furthermore,</b> one cannot draw parallels between the opinions of the two sources, as <b>here</b> the <i>tanna’im</i> <b>disagree with regard to</b> the exposition of certain <b>verses, and there they disagree with regard to</b> the exposition of certain other <b>verses. As Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: All</b> of the Sages who disagree as to whether one may let the blood of the firstborn animal <b>concede that one who leavens</b> a meal offering <b>after</b> another had already <b>leavened</b> it is <b>liable</b> to receive lashes for the additional leavening, <b>as it is written: “It shall not be baked with leaven”</b> (Leviticus 6:10), <b>and</b> it is also stated: “No meal offering that you sacrifice to God <b>shall be made</b> with leaven” (Leviticus 2:11). This indicates that one is liable for every act of leavening performed on a meal offering.",
        "Similarly, everyone agrees <b>that one who castrates</b> an animal <b>after one who has</b> already <b>castrated</b> it <b>is liable, as it is written: “Those whose testicles are bruised or crushed or detached or cut</b> shall not be offered to the Lord, and you shall not do this in your land” (Leviticus 22:24). <b>If one is liable</b> when the seminal vesicles <b>are cut,</b> then when the testicles <b>are detached</b> altogether, is he <b>not all the more so</b> liable? <b>Rather,</b> this verse serves to <b>include</b> one who <b>detaches</b> the testicles <b>after</b> one who <b>cuts</b> the seminal vesicles, to indicate <b>that he is liable.</b> Apparently, one is liable for castrating an animal that is already sterilized.",
        "These Sages <b>disagree only with regard to one who causes a blemish in</b> an already <b>blemished</b> animal, such as one whose blood circulation is constricted. <b>As Rabbi Meir maintains</b> that as the verse states: “It shall be perfect to be accepted; <b>there shall be no blemish in it”</b> (Leviticus 22:21), this categorical statement includes even the causing of a blemish in an offering that is already blemished. <b>And the Rabbis maintain</b> that the phrase <b>“It shall be perfect to be accepted”</b> indicates that the prohibition against causing a blemish applies only to an animal that is currently perfect, i.e., unblemished, and can therefore be accepted, i.e., it is fit to be sacrificed upon the altar. If the animal is already blemished, there is no prohibition against causing an additional blemish in it.",
        "The Gemara asks: <b>And Rabbi Meir, what does he do with this</b> verse: <b>“It shall be perfect to be accepted”?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> verse serves <b>to exclude</b> only an animal that was <b>blemished from the outset,</b> i.e., an animal that was born with a blemish. In such a case, there is no prohibition against causing an additional blemish in it. But if the animal was initially unblemished and later developed a blemish, it is prohibited to cause another blemish in it.",
        "The Gemara rejects this suggestion: There is no need to exclude an animal that was <b>blemished from the outset,</b> as <b>it is merely like a palm tree,</b> i.e., it can never attain the status of an animal consecrated as an offering. Therefore, it is obvious that the prohibition against causing a blemish does not apply to this animal.",
        "<b>Rather,</b> Rabbi Meir maintains that the phrase “It shall be perfect to be accepted” serves <b>to exclude disqualified consecrated</b> animals, to teach that <b>after their redemption,</b> when they become non-sacred, the prohibition against causing a blemish does not apply to them any longer. This exclusion is necessary, as it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that <b>since</b> even after they have been redeemed and are non-sacred, just as it is <b>prohibited</b> to <b>shear</b> these animals <b>or</b> use them for <b>labor,</b> perhaps <b>let</b> it <b>also be prohibited</b> to cause <b>a blemish upon them.</b> Consequently, this verse <b>teaches us</b> that there is no prohibition against causing a blemish in these animals.",
        "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> as for <b>the Rabbis as well,</b> who derive their opinion from the verse: “It shall be perfect to be accepted,” <b>isn’t it written: “There shall not be any blemish in it,”</b> which indicates an expansion of the prohibition against causing a blemish upon an offering? The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> verse <b>comes</b> to teach <b>that</b> the prohibition against causing a blemish extends also to a blemish caused as the result of <b>an indirect</b> action. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“There shall not be</b> any <b>blemish in it”</b> (Leviticus 22:21); from here <b>I have</b> derived"
      ],
      [
        "<b>only</b> the prohibition <b>that one may not</b> directly <b>cause a blemish. From where</b> is it derived <b>that one may not bring</b> pressed <b>figs or dough and place it on the</b> animal’s <b>ear so that a dog will come and eat it,</b> thereby biting off part of the animal’s ear and leaving it blemished? <b>The verse states:</b> “There shall not be <b>any blemish</b> in it” (Leviticus 22:21), indicating that the same prohibition applies <b>both</b> when the <b>blemish</b> is caused directly <b>and</b> when it is <b>any blemish,</b> even one caused indirectly.",
        "After demonstrating that the <i>tanna’im</i> in the <i>baraita</i> discussing the firstborn offering disagree with regard to the exposition of certain verses, the Gemara clarifies that the <i>tanna’im</i> <b>here,</b> in the <i>baraita</i> discussing <i>teruma</i> whose status concerning impurity is uncertain, also <b>disagree with regard to</b> the exposition of <b>verses. As Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says, and Reish Lakish likewise says, and Rav Naḥman likewise says</b> that <b>Rabba bar Avuh says:</b> It is stated in a verse addressed to Aaron and his sons: <b>“And I, behold, I have given you the charge of My <i>terumot</i> [<i>terumotai</i>]”</b> (Numbers 18:8), with “<i>terumotai</i>” written in plural.",
        "<b>Rabbi Eliezer,</b> who holds that the barrel of <i>teruma</i> must be safeguarded from ritual impurity, <b>holds that the verse is speaking of two <i>terumot</i>: Both <i>teruma</i> that is</b> definitely <b>ritually pure and <i>teruma</i> that is in abeyance,</b> i.e., <i>teruma</i> whose status with regard to impurity is uncertain. <b>And</b> based on the plural “My <i>terumot</i>,” it is understood that <b>the Merciful One states: Make a protection for it,</b> i.e., safeguard even <i>teruma</i> whose status concerning impurity is uncertain. <b>And Rabbi Yehoshua,</b> who holds that one may expose to ritual impurity the <i>teruma</i> contents in the barrel, holds that the term <i>terumotai</i> is <b>written</b> so that it can be read as <b><i>terumati</i>,</b> meaning: My <i>teruma</i>, in the singular. Therefore, the requirement to safeguard <i>teruma</i> applies only to that <i>teruma</i> whose status is definitely pure.",
        "The Gemara asks: Is this <b>to say that Rabbi Eliezer holds</b> that <b>the vocalization</b> of the Torah <b>is authoritative,</b> i.e., one derives <i>halakhot</i> based on the pronunciation of the words, although it diverges from the spelling? <b>And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from a <i>baraita</i> discussing a Hebrew maidservant’s return to her father’s house. The verse states, with regard to her master: “He shall have no power to sell her to a foreign people, <b>seeing that he has dealt deceitfully with her [<i>bevigdo bah</i>]”</b> (Exodus 21:8). The term “<i>bevigdo</i>” shares a root with a word for garment, <i>beged</i>. Therefore, the verse indicates that <b>once</b> the master <b>has spread his garment over her,</b> thereby designating her as his wife, if the maidservant is subsequently divorced or widowed, her father <b>may no longer sell her.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Akiva,</b> who maintains that the vocalization of the Torah is authoritative, and he interprets <i>bevigdo</i> as related to <i>bigdo</i>, his garment.",
        "<b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> The word <i>bevigdo</i> is written without a <i>yod</i> and therefore is written in a manner that it can be read: <i>Bevagdo</i>. Accordingly, <i>bevigdo bah</i> means that <b>since</b> the father <b>dealt deceitfully [<i>bagad</i>] with her</b> by selling her once, <b>he may not sell her again.</b> Evidently, Rabbi Eliezer maintains that the manner in which the verses in the Torah are written is authoritative, and one derives <i>halakhot</i> based on the spelling of the words. This contradicts his derivation with regard to <i>teruma</i>, which is based on the pronunciation of the words.",
        "<b>Rather, here,</b> the <i>tanna’im</i> <b>disagree with regard to this:</b> The verse states: “And I, behold, I have given you the charge of My <i>terumot</i>” (Numbers 18:8). <b>Rabbi Yehoshua holds</b> that the term “you” teaches that only <i>teruma</i> <b>that is fit for you</b> to eat, i.e., <i>teruma</i> that is definitely ritually pure, you must <b>safeguard. But</b> <i>teruma</i> <b>that is not fit for you,</b> i.e., <i>teruma</i> whose status with regard to impurity is uncertain, <b>you</b> do <b>not</b> need to <b>safeguard. And Rabbi Eliezer</b> holds that <b>this</b> <i>teruma</i>, whose status with regard to impurity is uncertain, is <b>also</b> considered <b>fit</b> for you, because <b>perhaps Elijah will come and deem it ritually pure.</b>"

      "We learned that some who come to console the bereaved are exempt from <i>Shema</i> as a means of honoring the deceased. The Gemara expands the discussion to raise the general question: To what degree does preserving human dignity take precedence over mitzvot enumerated in the Torah? <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said: One who discovers diverse kinds [<i>kilayim</i>],</b> i.e., a prohibited mixture of wool and linen, <b>in his garment, must remove them even in the</b> public <b>marketplace.</b> He may not wait until he reaches home. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? As it is stated: <b>“There is neither wisdom, nor understanding, nor counsel against the Lord”</b> (Proverbs 21:30). From here, the general principle: <b>Anywhere that there is desecration of the Lord’s name, one does not show respect to the teacher,</b> is derived.",
      "The Gemara cites several sources to challenge this principle. The Gemara <b>raised an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: After <b>they buried the deceased and returned, and</b> on their way <b>there are two paths before them, one ritually pure and one ritually impure,</b> e.g., it passes through a cemetery, if the mourner <b>comes on the pure</b> path, <b>they come with him on the pure</b> path; if <b>he comes on the impure</b> path, all of the funeral participants <b>accompany</b> him <b>on the impure</b> path in order to show <b>him respect. Why</b> would they do this? <b>Let us say</b> here too that, <b>“There is neither wisdom, nor understanding…against the Lord!”</b>",
      "<b>Rabbi Abba explained</b> that the <i>baraita</i> is referring to a path that passes <b>through an area where there is uncertainty with regard to the location of a grave or a corpse</b> [<b><i>beit haperas</i>].</b> For example, with regard to a field in which there is a grave that was plowed and no longer intact, the entire field is deemed impure due to concern that the plow scattered bones throughout the field. The field is impure only <b>by rabbinic law</b> but not according to Torah law. Since it is only prohibited by rabbinic law, one is permitted to walk through the field to show the mourner respect.",
      "The Gemara cites proof that the legal status of a <i>beit haperas</i> is unlike the legal status of impurity by Torah law: <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: One</b> who passes through <b>a <i>beit haperas</i> may blow</b> on the dust before taking each step, so that if there is a bone beneath the dust, he will expose it, avoid it, <b>and walk.</b> One may not rely on that method of examination with regard to impurity by Torah law. <b>And Rav Yehuda bar Ashi said in the name of Rav: A <i>beit haperas</i> that has been trodden</b> underfoot, creating a path, <b>is pure,</b> and one no longer need be concerned about bones. Clearly, the entire prohibition is a stringency decreed by the Sages."

      "Furthermore, <b>I might have</b> thought <b>that one may make his voice heard in his</b> <i>Amida</i> <b>prayer; it has already been articulated by Hannah</b> in her prayer, <b>as it is stated:</b> “And Hannah spoke in her heart, only her lips moved <b>and her voice could not be heard”</b> (I Samuel 1:13).",
      "<i>Halakhot</i> regarding the order of the prayers were also learned from the prayers of biblical characters.

Therefore, one who is praying <b>does not speak matters of request after</b> he began to recite <b><i>emet veyatziv</i></b> prior to the <i>Amida</i> prayer, which is the essence of prayer.
