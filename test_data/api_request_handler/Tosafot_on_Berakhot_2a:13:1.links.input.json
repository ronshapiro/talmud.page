    "text": "The Gemara responds: Indeed it would have been simpler to say that the time for the recitation of the evening <i>Shema</i> begins with the emergence of the stars, but the particular expression used by the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches us</b> another <b>matter in passing: When do priests partake of their <i>teruma</i>? From the time of the emergence of the stars. And</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches us</b> a new <i>halakha</i> parenthetically: failure to bring an <b>atonement</b> offering <b>does not prevent</b> a priest from eating <i>teruma</i>. In cases where an impure priest is required to immerse himself in a ritual bath and bring an atonement offering, even if he already immersed himself, he is not completely ritually pure until he brings the atonement offering. Nevertheless, he is still permitted to partake of <i>teruma</i>. Taught in passing in our mishna, this is articulated fully in a <i>baraita</i>, based on a close reading of the biblical passages. <b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the laws of ritual impurity, it is said: “One who touches it remains impure until evening. He should not eat of the consecrated items and he must wash his flesh with water. And the sun sets and it is purified. Afterwards, he may eat from the <i>teruma</i>, for it is his bread” (Leviticus 22:6–7). From the passage: <b>“And the sun sets and it is purified,”</b> that the absence of <b>the setting of his sun prevents him from partaking of <i>teruma</i>, but</b> failure to bring <b>the atonement</b> offering <b>does not prevent him from partaking of <i>teruma</i>,</b> may be inferred.",
