Before beginning the prayer, take three steps backwards and then return to your former position. Upon completing the prayer, take three steps backwards and return.<br>2. Keep your feet together.<br>3. Concentrate on the meaning of the words you are uttering. Remove all distracting thoughts and worries from your mind.<br>4. You may not interrupt </i>Shemoneh Esrei<i> by talking, not even by answering Amein. If you should hear </i>Kedushah, Kaddish,<i> or </i>Barechu<i> while saying the </i>Shemoneh Esrei,<i> you should remain silent and listen to the Chazzan’s words.<br>5. At the beginning and end of the first blessing, at the beginning and end of the blessing that begins: “We are thankful to You,” (page 133) and ends with “The Beneficent is Your Name,” (page 140) we half-kneel and bow in the following manner: At the word “Blessed,” bend your knees; at the word “You,” bend forward until the vertebrae of your spinal cord are loosened; at “Adonoy,” return to your upright position in keeping with the verse, “Adonoy straightens the bent” (Psalms 146:8).<br>6. Each individual recites </i>Shemoneh Esrei<i> in silence. Only the prayer leader, the </i>Chazzan,<i> ever recites it aloud, and then only after the entire congregation, himself included, has recited it silently.</i>",
