    "en": "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If an alleyway is enclosed on three sides with courtyards opening into it from three sides, and the fourth side opens into a public domain, it is prohibited by rabbinic law to carry objects in it on Shabbat. However, carrying in an alleyway under those circumstances is permitted if a cross beam is placed horizontally over the entrance to the alleyway. The mishna teaches that if the cross beam spans the entrance to <b>an alleyway</b> at a <b>height above twenty cubits, one must diminish</b> the height of the cross beam so that it is less than twenty cubits. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: He need not</b> diminish it, since the cross beam enables one to carry in the alleyway even at that height.",
