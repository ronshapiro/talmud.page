      "<b>Rav Yehuda said:</b> If several courtyards open onto a common alleyway, the residents of the houses in the courtyards are prohibited to carry in the alleyway, unless the alleyway is rendered fit for one to carry within it by placing a side post or a cross beam at its entrance, and by the inhabitants of each courtyard placing food in a common area for the duration of Shabbat, symbolically converting the entire alleyway into a single household. It is prohibited to carry in <b>an alleyway</b> that the residents <b>did not merge.</b> Nevertheless, if the alleyway <b>was rendered fit by</b> means of <b>a side post</b> placed at its entrance, <b>one who throws</b> an object <b>into it</b> from the public domain <b>is liable;</b> the side post functions as a partition, and the alleyway is deemed a full-fledged private domain.

      "<b>Rav Sheshet strongly objects to this</b> due to the following: <b>The reason</b> that one is exempt in the latter case is due to the fact the residents of the alleyway <b>did not merge.</b> By inference, <b>if they did</b> in fact <b>merge, one would be liable even if</b> the alleyway <b>was rendered fit by</b> way of a cross <b>beam.</b> This, however, is difficult.

      "The Gemara asks: <b>Shall we say</b> that <b>this is a refutation</b> of the opinion <b>of Rav Huna,</b> for the <i>baraita</i> explicitly contradicts his opinion? The Gemara rejects this argument: <b>Rav Huna</b> could have <b>said to you: There,</b> the <i>baraita</i> is dealing with a case where the two courtyards <b>later became joined</b> by means of the wall that separated them being breached, and it is clear to all that it is a single courtyard, so that there is no concern that people will say that an <i>eiruv</i> is effective for the area between the boards.",
      "<b>Abaye asked Rabba</b> yet another question: If <b>the water</b> in the cistern <b>dried up on Shabbat, what is</b> the law? Is it still permitted to carry between the boards?

      "<b>Ravin raised a dilemma: If the water</b> in the well <b>dried up on Shabbat, and</b> then <b>on</b> the same <b>Shabbat</b> it rained and other water <b>came</b> in its place, <b>what is</b> the law?

      "The case where other water <b>came</b> on Shabbat <b>should also not be a dilemma for you, for</b> this <b>is</b> a case of <b>a partition erected on Shabbat, and it was</b> already <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Any partition erected on Shabbat, whether</b> it was erected <b>unwittingly, or whether intentionally, whether by unavoidable accident, or whether willingly, it is called</b> a valid <b>partition.</b> The fact that it was erected in a prohibited manner, in violation of prohibitions related to building, does not negate its effectiveness.",
      "Ravin raised a difficulty: <b>Was it not stated with regard</b> to this <i>halakha</i> that <b>Rav Naḥman said: They only taught</b> that such a partition is called a partition as a stringency; it is prohibited by Torah law <b>to throw</b> objects from an area enclosed by such a partition into the public domain and vice versa, <b>but to carry in it</b> as a full-fledged private domain is <b>not</b> permitted by the Sages?",
      "The Gemara refutes this objection: <b>Rav Naḥman’s statement applies</b> only in a case where the partition was erected <b>intentionally.</b> Since the partition was erected intentionally on Shabbat, the Sages imposed a penalty that it is prohibited to carry within the enclosed area. However, in the case of a partition that was erected unwittingly or that arose by itself, no such penalty was imposed, and it is permitted to carry there.",
      "<b>Rabbi Elazar said: One who throws</b> an object from the public domain <b>into</b> the area <b>between the</b> upright <b>boards surrounding a well is liable.</b> The Gemara asks: This is <b>obvious,</b> for <b>were it not</b> a valid <b>partition, how could he be permitted to draw</b> water from the well? This shows that it is a full-fledged private domain.",
      "The Gemara answers: Rabbi Elazar’s ruling <b>is only necessary</b> to teach that in the case <b>where one arrange</b> an enclosure <b>similar to the</b> upright <b>boards surrounding a well in the public domain,</b> in a place where there was no well, <b>and threw</b> an object <b>into it</b> from the public domain, <b>he is liable.</b>",
      "The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>Isn’t this obvious as well?</b> As, <b>were it not</b> regarded as <b>a partition in general, how could he be permitted to carry in</b> the case of <b>a cistern?</b> The Gemara explains: <b>It is only necessary</b> to teach you that <b>even though</b> such a partition does not bar entry and <b>many</b> people <b>pass through it,</b> it is nonetheless considered a partition in regard to Shabbat.",
      "The Gemara asks: <b>And what is he teaching us</b> by this statement, <b>that the</b> passage of <b>many</b> people <b>does not come and negate</b> the effectiveness of <b>a partition? But Rabbi Elazar stated</b> this idea <b>once</b> before.",
      "<b>As we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>Rabbi Yehuda says</b> the following with regard to the upright boards surrounding a well: <b>If the path of the public domain</b> passes through the area of the wells and the posts and <b>obstructs them, he</b> must <b>divert it to the sides,</b> or else the partition is invalid. <b>And the Rabbis say: He need not</b> divert the path of the public domain, for even if many people pass through there, the partition is valid. With regard to this mishna, <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan and Rabbi Elazar both said: Here,</b> the Rabbis <b>informed you of the strength of partitions.</b> Therefore, we see that Rabbi Elazar already expressed his opinion that the validity of a partition is not canceled by the passage of many people through it.",
      "The Gemara answers: <b>If</b> it was derived <b>from there</b> alone, <b>I would have said</b> that what Rabbi Elazar meant is that <b>here</b> the Rabbis informed you of the strength of partitions, <b>but he,</b> Rabbi Elazar, <b>does not agree</b> with them. <b>He</b> therefore <b>teaches us</b> in his present ruling that what he meant is that <b>here</b> they informed you of this law <b>and he agrees</b> with them.",
      "The Gemara asks: If so, <b>let</b> Rabbi Elazar <b>say this</b> ruling that one who throws an object into the area enclosed by upright boards is liable, <b>and he would not have need to</b> make his <b>other</b> comment that here the Rabbis informed you of the strength of partitions. The Gemara answers: Rabbi Elazar did not in fact make two statements, but rather <b>one was stated by inference from the other.</b> He only made one of these statements explicitly; the other was reported by his students in his name based on an inference from what he had said."

        "The Gemara responds: <b>And what is the difficulty</b> with <b>that? Perhaps the design of the Sanctuary was like the design of the Entrance Hall.</b> Just as there were cornices in one doorway, there were cornices in the other.",
        "The Gemara returns to its question with regard to a cornice: <b>Why</b> then <b>did Rabbi Ile’a say</b> that <b>Rav</b> himself <b>said:</b> If the <b>width</b> of a cross beam is <b>four</b> handbreadths, <b>even if it is not sturdy,</b> it renders the alleyway fit for carrying within it. <b>And if it has a cornice, even if it is higher than twenty cubits, one need not diminish</b> its height.",
        "<b>Rav Yosef said:</b> This <i>halakha</i> with regard to a <b>cornice</b> was not actually stated by Rav, but rather it <b>is a <i>baraita</i>.

        "<b>Rav</b> could have <b>said to you:</b> Even if you <b>eliminate me</b> and my explanation <b>from</b> the discussion <b>here, don’t the</b> two <b><i>baraitot</i></b> themselves, the <i>baraita</i> that states that the Rabbis derive the dimensions of an entrance from the doorway of the Sanctuary and the <i>baraita</i> that states that in the case of a cornice, even if it is higher than twenty cubits, it need not be lowered, <b>contradict each other? Rather, what have you to say</b> to reconcile the contradiction? The matter is the subject of a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>; so too, according to my</b> opinion, it <b>is</b> the subject of a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>.</b>",
        "<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: Without Rav, the <i>baraitot</i> do not contradict each other,</b> as <b>according to the Rabbis, what is the reason</b> that <b>a</b> cross <b>beam</b> renders an alleyway fit for carrying? Because it serves <b>as a conspicuous marker</b> between the alleyway and the public domain. Ordinarily a cross beam more than twenty cubits high is not noticeable; however, a cornice attracts attention even at that height. <b>And that which is taught</b> in the other <i>baraita</i> with regard to the height of a beam at the entrance to an alleyway: <b>Greater than the entrance of the Sanctuary,</b> is <b>merely</b> a <b>mnemonic</b> device. No actual <i>halakhot</i> are derived from the entrance of the Sanctuary.",
        "The Gemara notes: <b>And</b> that the explanation of <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak works out well if he does not hold this</b> opinion <b>of Rabba; however, if he holds this</b> opinion <b>of Rabba,</b> it is difficult. As <b>Rabba said</b> with regard to the fitness of a <i>sukka</i> whose roofing is higher than twenty cubits that <b>it is written: “In order that your generations should know that I made</b> the children of Israel <b>dwell in booths</b> when I brought them out of the land of Egypt; I am the Lord your God” (Leviticus 23:43). When the roofing of a <i>sukka</i> is <b>up to twenty cubits</b> high, <b>a person is aware that he is dwelling in a <i>sukka</i>;</b> however, when the roofing of the <i>sukka</i> is <b>above twenty cubits, a person is not aware</b> that he is dwelling in a <i>sukka</i>, <b>because the eye does not discern</b> the <i>sukka</i> roofing. One does not usually raise his head to look that high, and consequently, he sees the walls and does not notice the defining feature of the <i>sukka</i>, its roofing.",
        "The Gemara explains the difficulty: <b>Apparently, with regard to <i>sukka</i> as well,</b> the Rabbis and Rabbi Yehuda <b>disagree</b> whether or not an item more than twenty cubits high is <b>conspicuous.</b> According to Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak, <b>why do I</b> need them to <b>disagree</b> about the same point <b>in two cases,</b> that of <i>sukka</i> and that of an alleyway? That the dispute between the Rabbis and Rabbi Yehuda with regard to <i>sukka</i> revolves around this issue indicates that their dispute with regard to an alleyway revolves around a different point, as asserted by Rav.",
        "The Gemara answers: It is <b>necessary</b> to teach both disputes, <b>as had</b> the mishna <b>taught us</b> only <b>with regard to <i>sukka</i>,</b> one might have thought that only <b>in this</b> case does <b>Rabbi Yehuda say</b> that an object is conspicuous even above twenty cubits; <b>since</b> a <i>sukka</i> <b>is designed for</b> extended <b>dwelling, the eye</b> undoubtedly <b>discerns</b> the roofing at some point. <b>However,</b> in the case of <b>an alleyway,</b> which <b>is designed for walking, say</b> that <b>he concedes to</b> the <b>Rabbis</b> that a person walking in an alleyway does not notice objects at so significant a height. <b>And had</b> the mishna <b>taught us</b> only <b>with regard to that</b> case of an alleyway, one might have thought that only <b>in that</b> case do <b>the Rabbis say</b> that people do not notice objects at so significant a height; <b>however, in that</b> case of <i>sukka</i>, <b>say</b> that <b>they concede to Rabbi Yehuda,</b> for the above-stated reason.

        "<b>Rav Naḥman said to him: What is the reason</b> for bringing this example? <b>If you say</b> that <b>because</b> large numbers of people <b>are to be found at</b> the residence of <b>the governor [<i>harmana</i>]</b> in order to request licenses and authorizations, and <b>they remind each other</b> of the reason it is permissible to establish an <i>eiruv</i> there, and consequently they will not arrive at mistaken conclusions with regard to other places, then every city should have the same status, as <b>the entire Jewish people are also found together on Shabbat morning</b> when they come to pray. <b>Rather, Rav Naḥman said: For example, the village of Natzu’i</b> was a private city belonging to a single individual before a large influx of residents turned it into a public city.",
        "<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>a private city becomes public, and</b> a bona fide <b>public domain passes through it, how does one establish an <i>eiruv</i> for it?
