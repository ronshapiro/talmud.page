    "text": "“One marks the graves.” Were they not already marked in Adar? Explain it if there was a flood caused by rain which rinsed it off<sup>64</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This also is copied from <i>Mo`ed Qaṭan</i>. The question is why one should hire people to mark graves (or in the next paragraph to check for <i>kilaim</i>) on the semi-holidays approximately on the spring and fall equinoxes (Mishnah <i>Mo`ed Qaṭan</i>1:2) when they already had been checked in late winter. The reason that one tries to have all public works done on semi-holidays is that at that time most journeymen are without work and ready to work for lower wages. One provides work for the poor and saves taxpayer’s money at the same time. Cf. Babli <i>Mo`ed Qaṭan</i>6a.</i>.",
