The Gemara clarifies: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> to teach this <i>halakha</i> due to a place <b>where a scribe is not commonly available. Lest you say</b> that he wrote the marriage contract early because there was <b>a scribe who happened</b> to be there, and the prospective husband took the opportunity to avail himself of the scribe’s services while intending to perform the betrothal later, Rav Ashi therefore <b>teaches us</b> that there is no concern that he might have done so since the custom is to first betroth the woman.",

Resolution of this dilemma is dependent on <b>a dispute between Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri and the Rabbis.</b> Is oil considered a discrete entity placed on the wine? Or, perhaps it is considered to be connected to the wine? <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>Oil that was floating on top of wine and one who immersed himself during the day touched the oil, he disqualified only the oil alone</b> and not the wine, as he only touched the oil and the oil does not render the wine impure. <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri says: They both are</b> considered <b>connected to each other,</b> and therefore they are both rendered impure through the same contact.
