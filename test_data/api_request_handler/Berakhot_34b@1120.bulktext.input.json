    "en": "The Torah law obligating a man whose brother died without children [<i>yavam</i>] to marry his deceased brother’s widow [<i>yevama</i>] or to free her from her levirate bonds through the act of <i>ḥalitza</i> applies only when it is permitted for the widow to marry her surviving brother-in-law. However, in cases where the <i>yevama</i> is forbidden to her <i>yavam</i> due to her status as a close family relative, the mitzva of levirate marriage is not applicable, and she is exempt from both levirate marriage and <i>ḥalitza</i>.<br/>The Sages further taught that the exemption of a <i>yevama</i> from levirate marriage also exempts her rival wife. In other words, if the deceased brother had two wives, each a so-called rival of the other, and only one wife is a relative of the surviving brother, then the rival wife is also exempt from both levirate marriage and <i>ḥalitza</i>. Moreover, if that same rival wife entered into levirate marriage with a different brother of the deceased, one to whom she is not forbidden, then were this third brother also to die childless, so that the obligation of levirate marriage would again be incurred by the second brother, not only is the forbidden rival wife exempt from levirate marriage and <i>ḥalitza</i>, her new rival wives from her second marriage are also exempt.<br/>That is to say, any other wife of the third brother is exempt from the mitzva of levirate marriage, as she is the rival wife of that first rival wife, who was exempted from levirate marriage following her first husband’s death due the exemption of her original rival wife. The same principle applies if that second rival wife subsequently enters into levirate marriage with another permitted brother, and so on. In summary, every widow who is exempt from marrying her brother-in-law due to her status as rival wife of a forbidden relative is treated as a forbidden relative herself and is therefore exempt from both <i>ḥalitza</i> and levirate marriage and causes exemption for future rival wives as well.<br/><br/><strong>MISHNA:</strong> The mishna describes various cases that invoke the principles above. <b>Fifteen</b> categories of <b>women</b> constitute familial relations that are forbidden as incestuous, and consequently, these women <b>exempt their rival wives and the rival wives of their rival wives from <i>ḥalitza</i> and from levirate marriage forever,</b> i.e., they also exempt rival wives of rival wives of rival wives, and so on.",

      "The Gemara answers: <b>When we said</b> that the smoke was not displaced, indicating that the wood produced smoke, that was in reference to the fire brought by a <b>person, as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“And the sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire upon the altar”</b> (Leviticus 1:7), indicating that <b>even though fire descends from the heavens,</b> still there is a special <b>mitzva to bring fire by a person.</b> The fire that the priests brought produced smoke, and the miracle related to that smoke.",
      "The Gemara asks: And was the altar’s fire <b>crouched like a lion?

      "The Gemara asks: <b>And was there</b> fire that descended from the heavens <b>in the Second Temple? Didn’t Rav Shmuel bar Inya say: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written</b> with regard to the Second Temple: “Go up to the hills and get wood and build the house; <b>and I will look on it favorably and I will be glorified [<i>ve’ekkaved</i>],</b> said the Lord” (Haggai 1:8)? Even though it is written <i>ve’ekkaved</i>, <b>we read it <i>ve’ikkavda</i>,</b> with an added letter <i>heh</i>. The Gemara explains: <b>What is different</b> that the word is <b>missing</b> the letter <b><i>heh</i>? This</b> represents <b>five,</b> the numerological value of <i>heh</i>, <b>phenomena</b> that constituted the difference <b>between</b> the <b>First Temple</b> and the <b>Second Temple,</b> in that they were not in the Second Temple. <b>And these are: The Ark</b> of the Covenant, <b>and the Ark cover</b> upon it, <b>and the cherubs</b> that were on the Ark cover; <b>fire; and</b> the <b>Divine Presence; and the Divine Spirit; and the <i>Urim VeTummim</i>.</b> Apparently, there was no fire from heaven in the Second Temple. The Sages <b>say</b> in response: <b>Yes, there was</b> fire from heaven in the Second Temple; however, <b>it did not assist</b> in burning the offerings but was merely visible above the wood.",
      "Apropos the fire on the altar, the Gemara cites a related <i>baraita</i>. <b>The Sages taught</b> that <b>there are six kinds of fire: There is</b> fire that <b>consumes solids and does not consume liquids; and there is</b> fire that <b>consumes liquids and does not consume solids; and there is</b> fire that <b>consumes solids and consumes liquids; and there is</b> fire that <b>consumes wet</b> objects <b>like dry</b> objects; <b>and there is fire that repels</b> other <b>fire; and there is fire that consumes</b> other <b>fire.</b>",
      "The Gemara elaborates: <b>There is fire that consumes solids and does not consume liquids; that is our</b> standard fire that consumes dry items but does not dry liquids. <br/>Fire that <b>consumes liquids and does not consume solids</b> is the fever <b>of the sick</b> that dehydrates the body but does not consume the flesh. <br/>Fire that <b>consumes solids and consumes liquids</b> is the fire <b>of Elijah</b> the Prophet, <b>as it is written:</b> “And fire fell from the sky and consumed the offering and the wood and the stones and the earth, <b>and it licked up the water that was in the trench”</b> (I Kings 18:38). <br/>Fire that <b>consumes wet</b> objects <b>like dry</b> objects is the fire <b>of the arrangement of wood.</b> <br/><b>There is fire that repels</b> other <b>fire;</b> that is the fire <b>of</b> the angel <b>Gabriel.</b> The book of Daniel relates that Gabriel was an angel of fire who descended to the fiery furnace, repelled the fire, and rescued Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, who had been cast inside. <br/><b>And there is fire that consumes</b> other <b>fire;</b> that is the fire <b>of the Divine Presence, as the Master said</b> in another context: The Holy One, Blessed be He, <b>extended His finger</b> between the angels, who are also made of fire, <b>and burned them.</b> The fire of the Divine Presence consumed the fire of the angels."

      "§ The Gemara analyzes the above <i>baraita</i>. <b>The Master said</b> in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>And from where</b> is it derived <b>that he includes a smoke-raiser in its</b> spices? <b>The verse states: “And it shall cover”</b> (Leviticus 16:13). The Gemara expresses surprise at this statement: One <b>verse for</b> another <b>verse?</b> The requirement of a smoke-raiser was already proven from the verse: “For I will appear in a cloud upon the Ark cover” (Leviticus 16:2); why cite a second verse in support of the first one?",
      "<b>Rav Yosef said: This is</b> what the <i>baraita</i> <b>said;</b> this is how to understand the matter: <b>I have</b> derived <b>nothing other</b> than the obligation to bring <b>a leaf of a smoke-raising</b> plant. <b>From where</b> is it derived that he must also bring <b>a root of a smoke-raiser? The verse states: “And it shall cover,”</b> which indicates the requirement for more of the smoke-raiser than might have been supposed from the other verse.",
      "<b>Abaye said</b> to Rav Yosef: Your interpretation indicates that the leaf of the smoke-raiser raises smoke better than its root, as the requirement for a root is merely considered an addition. <b>But wasn’t the opposite taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>? <b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>He put into</b> the incense <b>a root of a smoke-raiser,</b> and the smoke <b>would rise in a column like a staff until it reached</b> the Temple <b>ceiling. When it reached</b> the <b>ceiling</b> there was nowhere for the smoke to exit the building, and therefore it slowly <b>descended the walls until the</b> entire <b>House was filled with smoke, as it is stated: “And the House was filled with smoke”</b> (Isaiah 6:4). This <i>baraita</i> indicates that the root of the smoke-raiser raises smoke better than its leaf.",
      "<b>Rather, Abaye said</b> that <b>this is</b> what the <i>baraita</i> <b>said;</b> this is how it should be understood: <b>I have</b> derived <b>nothing other</b> than the obligation to bring <b>a root of a smoke-raising</b> plant. <b>From where</b> is it derived that he must also bring <b>a leaf of a smoke-raiser? The verse states: “And it shall cover.”</b>",
      "<b>Rav Sheshet said</b> that the <i>baraita</i> means the following: <b>I have</b> derived <b>nothing other</b> than the inclusion of a smoke-raiser amongst the other spices in <b>the Tent of Meeting that</b> was <b>in the wilderness; from where</b> is it derived that this obligation extends to the Tabernacle at <b>Shiloh and</b> in <b>the eternal Temple</b> in Jerusalem? <b>The verse states: “And it shall cover,”</b> which indicates that wherever the High Priest enters the Holy of Holies to burn incense, he must include a smoke-raiser in its ingredients.",
      "The Gemara raises a difficulty with regard to this interpretation: <b>This</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>is derived from</b> the verse: <b>“And so shall he do for the Tent of Meeting that dwells with them”</b> (Leviticus 16:16). This verse teaches that this rite must be performed not only that first time in the wilderness, but wherever the Divine Presence dwells.",
      "<b>Rather, this is</b> what the <i>baraita</i> <b>said: I have</b> derived <b>nothing other</b> than the obligation to include a smoke-raiser in the spices of the incense offered <b>on Yom Kippur</b> in the Holy of Holies; <b>from where</b> is it derived that this obligation applies to the incense offered <b>on the rest of the days of the year</b> in the Sanctuary? <b>The verse states: “And it shall cover,”</b> to teach that every incense burned in the Temple must include a smoke-raiser.",
      "<b>Rav Ashi said: One</b> verse teaches us <b>the mitzva</b> itself, <b>and one</b> verse teaches that this requirement is <b>indispensable,</b> i.e., the rite is invalid if one omits this ingredient. <b>Rava said: One</b> verse teaches that the omission of the smoke-raiser renders one liable to receive the <b>punishment</b> of death, <b>and one</b> verse serves <b>as a warning</b> that it is prohibited to omit it, as the Torah does not require punishment without issuing a warning.",
      "§ <b>It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> “Speak to Aaron your brother that he should not come at all times into the sacred place within the curtain, before the Ark cover that is upon the Ark; <b>that he not die”</b> (Leviticus 16:2). This verse teaches the <b>punishment</b> for the omission of the smoke-raiser from the spices of the incense. With regard to the verse: <b>“For I will appear in a cloud</b> upon the Ark cover” (Leviticus 16:2); this is the <b>warning</b> that it is prohibited to omit the smoke-raiser, which causes the cloud to rise.",
      "One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>both</b> verses <b>were said before the deaths of Aaron’s sons,</b> who died upon entering the sacred place. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “After the deaths of the two sons of Aaron”</b> (Leviticus 16:1). One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>both of them,</b> the punishment and the warning, <b>were said after the deaths of Aaron’s two sons.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “For I will appear in a cloud upon the Ark cover</b>.” <b>How so;</b> how should these verses be understood? The <b>warning</b> was said <b>before</b> the <b>death</b> of Aaron’s sons, <b>and the punishment</b> associated with it was stated <b>after the death</b> of his sons.",
      "The Gemara expresses puzzlement at Rabbi Eliezer’s statement: <b>What is the</b> biblical <b>derivation?</b> How does Rabbi Eliezer learn from the phrase “I will appear” that the warning was stated earlier? <b>Rava said</b> that <b>the verse states: “For I will appear in a cloud”;</b> the future tense indicates that the cloud over the Ark cover <b>had not yet appeared,</b> as the Tabernacle had not been built, which means that this command was issued before Aaron’s sons entered and died. The Gemara asks: <b>Rather, what is the reason</b> that Aaron’s sons <b>were punished</b> with death, if the punishment had not been stated? The Torah does not punish one who is unaware of the sin’s punishment.",
      "The Gemara answers: They were not punished for their entry into the sacred place but for a different reason, <b>as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: Aaron’s sons died only because they taught a <i>halakha</i> before Moses their teacher;</b> they should have asked him for his ruling, but they neglected to do so. The Gemara asks: <b>What did they interpret</b> from the verse that led them to enter the sacred place with fire? The verse states: <b>“And the sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire upon the altar”</b> (Leviticus 1:7), which indicates that <b>although fire descends from the heavens,</b> it is a <b>mitzva to bring man-made</b> fire. To fulfill this mitzva, Aaron’s sons entered and brought fire to the altar. Although their ruling was in accordance with the <i>halakha</i>, they incurred the death penalty for failing to ask Moses."

        "§ The <i>baraita</i> teaches: <b>“With the bull”</b> (Leviticus 4:20), <b>this</b> alludes to <b>the bull of Yom Kippur. To what <i>halakha</i></b> does this statement relate? <b>If</b> it serves <b>to</b> teach that all matters stated with regard to the bull of Yom Kippur are <b>indispensable,</b> this is <b>obvious,</b> since the word <b>“statute” is written concerning it:</b> “And this shall be an everlasting statute to you” (Leviticus 16:29), and there is a principle that <i>halakhot</i> described as statutes are indispensable.",
        "<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said:</b> This statement <b>is necessary only according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, who says: When</b> the term <b>“statute” is written</b> concerning the Yom Kippur service, indicating that no details may be altered, it is written only <b>with regard to actions performed in white garments inside</b> the Holy of Holies, e.g., burning the incense and sprinkling the blood, which are the essential services of the day, and it teaches <b>that if</b> the High Priest <b>performed</b> one of the <b>actions before another,</b> i.e., not in the proper order, <b>he has done nothing.</b>",
        "<b>But</b> with regard to <b>those actions performed in white garments outside,</b> in the Sanctuary, if he <b>performed</b> one <b>action before another, what he did is done</b> and he is not required to repeat the rite. Consequently, one might <b>say</b> that <b>from</b> the fact <b>that their order is not indispensable,</b> it may be derived that the <b>sprinklings,</b> i.e., placements, <b>themselves are also not indispensable.</b> Therefore, the term “with the bull” <b>teaches us</b> that the placements are indeed indispensable.",
        "<b>Rav Pappa objects to this: And how can you say this,</b> that Rabbi Yehuda derives from here that the placements are indispensable? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse discussing the Yom Kippur service states: <b>“And when he has finished atoning for the Sanctuary”</b> (Leviticus 16:20). This indicates that <b>if he performed the atonement,</b> i.e., the sprinklings, inside the Sanctuary, <b>he has finished</b> the order of the service, even though he has not poured the remainder of the blood on the base of the altar; <b>and if he did not perform the atonement, he has not finished;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Akiva.</b>",
        "<b>Rabbi Yehuda said to him: For what</b> reason <b>do we not say: If he finished</b> the entire service, which includes sprinkling the blood in the Sanctuary and pouring the remainder of the blood onto the base of the altar, <b>he has facilitated atonement; and if he did not finish, he has not facilitated atonement?</b> This indicates that Rabbi Yehuda derives from this verse the <i>halakha</i> that the sprinklings in the Sanctuary are indispensable.",
        "<b>Rav Pappa says:</b> This reference to the bull of Yom Kippur in the term “with the bull,” <b>is necessary only to</b> apply to the bull of Yom Kippur three <i>halakhot</i> that are derived from that which is stated with regard to the bull for an unwitting sin of the anointed priest: “And the priest shall immerse his finger [<i>et etzba’o</i>] in the blood” (Leviticus 4:6). These <i>halakhot</i> can be summarized in the shortened form: <b><i>Et</i>, blood, and with immersion.</b> The Gemara elaborates: With regard to the word <b><i>et</i>, Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov says:</b> This word <b>is necessary only to render fit</b>"

        "service performed by a priest who has <b>a wart</b> or blister <b>on</b> his <b>finger.</b> These are not considered an interposition between his finger and the blood. With regard to the term <b>“in the blood”</b> (Leviticus 4:6), this teaches <b>that the blood</b> in the service vessel <b>must be of a</b> sufficient <b>measure for immersion from the outset.</b> The priest must initially collect in the vessel enough blood for all the sprinklings, rather than adding blood to the vessel for each sprinkling. Finally, the term <b>“and</b> the priest <b>shall immerse</b> his finger in the blood” indicates that there must be enough blood in the vessel such that the priest can immerse his finger in it <b>and not</b> have to <b>wipe</b> the sides of the utensil to collect blood for sprinkling.",
        "The Gemara explains: <b>And</b> it <b>was necessary</b> for the verse to state both these last two terms. It had <b>to write “in the blood,” as had the Merciful One written</b> only <b>“and</b> the priest <b>shall immerse,” I would say</b> that the sprinklings are valid <b>even if there was not</b> a sufficient <b>measure</b> of blood <b>for immersion from the outset,</b> but only enough for a single sprinkling, provided that the priest then added more blood to the vessel for each sprinkling. Therefore, <b>the Merciful One writes “in the blood”</b> to teach that from the outset there must be enough blood in the vessel for all the sprinklings.",
        "<b>And</b> conversely, <b>had the Merciful One written</b> only <b>“in the blood,” I would say</b> that <b>even</b> if there was enough blood in the vessel at the outset it is not necessary that there be enough blood for immersion for the last sprinklings, as the priest can <b>wipe</b> the sides of the utensil to collect blood for sprinkling. Therefore, <b>the Merciful One writes “and</b> the priest <b>shall immerse.”</b>",
        "The Gemara addresses another apparently superfluous phrase in the same chapter: “And the priest shall put some of the blood upon the corners of <b>the altar of sweet incense</b> before the Lord” (Leviticus 4:7). <b>Why do I</b> need the verse to mention the sweet incense? It would have been enough to identify the altar as being “before the Lord” and one would have understood that the reference is to the inner altar. Rather, this serves to teach <b>that if the altar had not been inaugurated with sweet incense,</b> the priest <b>would not sprinkle</b> blood on it."
