      "§ <b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Avya, said to Rav Ashi: From</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, we infer</b> the proper understanding of the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva. Don’t the Rabbis say</b> that the term <b>“soaked” teaches</b> that the principle that the legal status of the <b>flavor</b> of forbidden food is <b>like</b> that of its <b>substance</b> applies not only to a nazirite, but that <b>from here you derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard <b>to all prohibitions of the Torah? According to Rabbi Akiva as well, who establishes this</b> term: <b>“Soaked,” as</b> teaching that <b>the permitted</b> substance <b>combines with the forbidden</b> substance with regard to a nazirite, <b>let us say</b> that <b>from here you derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard <b>to all prohibitions of the Torah.</b> This explanation runs counter to the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan, who applies this principle only to a nazirite.",
      "Rav Ashi <b>said to him:</b> This cannot serve as a proof, <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>a nazirite and</b> those of <b>a sin-offering</b> are from <b>two verses that come as one,</b> i.e., to teach the same matter, <b>and any two verses that come as one do not teach</b> their common aspect to apply to other cases. The Gemara comments: The derivation that a permitted substance joins together with a forbidden substance in the case of <b>a nazirite</b> is <b>that which we stated,</b> from the term “soaked.” With regard to <b>a sin-offering, what is</b> the derivation that a permitted substance combines with a forbidden substance?",
      "It is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse discussing a sin-offering <b>“Anything that touches in its flesh shall become consecrated”</b> (Leviticus 6:20). One <b>might</b> have thought that non-sacred meat that touched any part of a sin-offering is consecrated <b>even if it did not absorb</b> the taste of the sin-offering it touched. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “In its flesh,”</b> to teach that this meat is not consecrated <b>until</b> the taste of the sin-offering <b>is absorbed within its flesh.</b>",
      "The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>“Shall become consecrated,”</b> means that its legal status <b>becomes like</b> that of the sin-offering itself; <b>that</b> is, <b>if</b> the sin-offering <b>is disqualified,</b> the non-sacred meat that touched it <b>will</b> also <b>be disqualified. And if</b> the sin-offering <b>is valid,</b> the non-sacred meat that touched it <b>may be eaten in accordance with the more stringent</b> standards <b>of</b> a sin-offering, with regard to when and where it may be eaten. The principle that a permitted substance combines with a forbidden substance is thereby stated in the case of a sin-offering as well. Consequently, the principle cannot be extended to the entire Torah, as a <i>halakha</i> stated in two cases is not applied elsewhere.",
      "<b>And the Rabbis,</b> who disagree with Rabbi Akiva, would maintain that both these sources <b>are necessary,</b> as neither the case of a nazirite nor the case of a sin-offering could be derived from the other. Therefore, this is not a case of two verses that come as one. The Gemara elaborates: <b>For had the Merciful One written</b> this <i>halakha</i> only <b>with regard to a sin-offering, I would say</b> that the case of <b>a nazirite cannot be derived from it, due to</b> the fact that <b>we do not derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>a nazirite from</b> that of <b>consecrated</b> items. This is because the prohibitions of naziriteship are unrelated to the Temple and offerings, and therefore it is possible that the <i>halakha</i> in question is unique to consecrated items.",
      "<b>And</b> conversely, <b>had the Merciful One written</b> this <i>halakha</i> only <b>with regard to a nazirite, I would say</b> that <b>we do not derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> of a sin-offering <b>from</b> that of <b>a nazirite due to</b> the fact <b>that its prohibition is stringent.</b> In what way? It is stringent <b>as even a grape seed is forbidden to</b> a nazirite, although the seeds are not usually eaten. <b>Therefore,</b> the <i>halakha</i> of a sin-offering <b>cannot be derived from</b> the case of a nazirite, which means that this is not a case of two verses that come as one. Consequently, one can derive a general <i>halakha</i> from them.",
      "<b>And Rabbi Akiva</b> could have <b>said to you,</b> in rebuttal of this claim: <b>Why are</b> these cases both <b>necessary? Granted, if the Merciful One had written</b> this principle only with regard <b>to a sin-offering,</b> one would <b>not derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>a nazirite from it,</b> as <b>we do not derive</b> <i>halakhot</i> of <b>non-sacred</b> items <b>from</b> those of <b>consecrated</b> items. Certain stringencies and strictures apply only to consecrated property. <b>However, let the Merciful One write</b> this principle <b>with regard to a nazirite, and you</b> could <b>derive</b> the case of the <b>sin-offering from</b> that of a nazirite, just <b>as</b> the application of this principle to <b>all prohibitions in the Torah is derived from</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>a nazirite.</b> Since it is not necessary to state this principle in both cases, one cannot derive a general principle from them.",
      "The Gemara asks: <b>And the Rabbis,</b> who maintain that the principle that the legal status of the flavor of a forbidden substance is like that of the substance itself is not limited to these two cases, <b>would say to you</b> that both sources are required. The case of <b>a sin-offering</b> is necessary <b>to</b> derive the principle <b>that a permitted</b> substance <b>combines with a forbidden</b> substance, <b>and</b> this stringency is not extrapolated to other prohibitions, in accordance with the principle that <b>one cannot derive</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>non-sacred</b> items <b>from consecrated</b> items.",
      "<b>And</b> the term <b>“soaked,”</b> which appears in the context of a nazirite, <b>teaches</b> the principle that the legal status of the <b>flavor</b> of forbidden food is <b>like</b> that of its <b>substance.</b> Since both examples are necessary, they are not considered two verses that come as one, and it is therefore possible to derive a general principle from them. <b>And</b> consequently, <b>from here you derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard <b>to all of the prohibitions of the Torah.</b>",
      "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how would <b>Rabbi Akiva</b> respond to this claim? The Gemara answers: Rabbi Akiva would say that <b>both</b> cases teach the principle <b>that a permitted</b> substance <b>combines with a forbidden</b> substance, <b>and they are two verses that come as one,</b> to teach about the same issue. <b>And</b> the rule is that <b>any two verses that come as one do not teach</b> their common aspect to apply to other cases."

        "<b>Rav Ḥisda and Rabba bar Rav Huna both say</b> that eight is also safe from the dangers of pairs, as the number seven, represented by the word <b><i>shalom</i>, combines</b> with the previous cups <b>for the good</b> but <b>does not combine for the bad.</b> The final verse of the priestly benediction reads: “The Lord lift His countenance upon you and give you peace [<i>shalom</i>]” (Numbers 6:26). The word <i>shalom</i>, the seventh Hebrew word in this verse, has a purely positive connotation. Rav Ḥisda and Rabba bar Rav Huna therefore maintain that the seventh cup combines with the previous six only for good purposes. After the seventh cup, i.e., from the eighth cup and on, the cups constitute pairs for the good but not for the bad. <b>However, six cups do contain the element of</b> danger associated with <b>pairs.</b>",
        "<b>Rabba and Rav Yosef both say</b> that even drinking six cups is not dangerous. The reason is that the fifth cup, represented by the word <b><i>viḥuneka</i></b> in the second verse of the priestly benediction: “The Lord make His face to shine upon you, and be gracious to you [<i>viḥuneka</i>]” (Numbers 6:25), <b>combines</b> with the previous cups <b>for the good</b> but <b>does not combine for the bad. However, four cups do contain the element of</b> danger associated with <b>pairs.</b>",
        "<b>Abaye and Rava both say</b> that even the number four is not dangerous, as <b><i>veyishmerekha</i>,</b> the third word in the first verse of the priestly benediction, reads: “The Lord bless you and keep you [<i>veyishmerekha</i>]” (Numbers 6:24). <b>It combines for the good</b> but <b>does not combine for the bad.</b>",
        "<b>And Rava follows his</b> standard line of <b>reasoning</b> in this regard, <b>as Rava</b> allowed <b>the Sages to leave</b> after having drunk <b>four cups</b> and was not concerned for their safety. <b>Although Rava bar Livai was injured</b> on one such occasion, Rava <b>was not concerned</b> that <b>the matter</b> had been caused by his consumption of an even number of cups, <b>as he said: That</b> injury occurred <b>because</b> Rava bar Livai <b>challenged me during the</b> public <b>lecture.</b> It is improper for a student to raise difficulties against his rabbi during a public lecture, lest the rabbi be embarrassed by his inability to answer.",
        "<b>Rav Yosef said: Yosef the Demon said to me: Ashmedai, the king of the demons, is appointed over all</b> who perform actions in <b>pairs, and a king is not called a harmful spirit.</b> A king would not cause harm. Consequently, there is no reason to fear the harm of demons for having performed an action in pairs. <b>Some say</b> this statement <b>in this manner: On the contrary, he is an angry king</b> who <b>does what he wants,</b> as the <i>halakha</i> is <b>that a king</b> may <b>breach the fence</b> of an individual <b>in order to form a path for himself, and none</b> may <b>protest his</b> action.

However, if there is more of the stringent material, the two substances do not combine halakhically to form the amount of the smaller requisite size.

        "Apropos this <i>halakha</i>, the Gemara discusses the matter <b>itself. Rabbi Shimon ben Pazi said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said in the name of Bar Kappara: The sound</b> of the musical instruments in the Temple and <b>the sight and smell</b> of the incense <b>are not subject to</b> the prohibition of <b>misuse of consecrated property.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Isn’t smell subject to</b> the prohibition of <b>misuse of consecrated property? Wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who prepares the incense</b> mixture in order <b>to teach</b> himself how to prepare it <b>or to transfer it to the community is exempt</b> from punishment. However, if one prepares it in order <b>to smell it, he is liable</b> to receive punishment, as it states in the Torah: “He who makes it in order to smell it shall be cut off from his people” (Exodus 30:38). <b>And one who</b> actually <b>smells</b> the incense mixture is <b>exempt</b> from the punishment of <i>karet</i> and from bringing a sin-offering; <b>however, he has misused consecrated property.</b> Apparently, the <i>halakha</i> of misuse of consecrated property applies to smelling.",
        "<b>Rather, Rav Pappa said: Sound and sight are not subject to</b> the prohibition of <b>misuse of consecrated property, because they have no substance. And</b> with regard to <b>the smell</b> of the spices themselves, the following distinction applies: The smell of the incense that is emitted when the spices are placed on the coals is subject to the prohibition, since this is the way the mitzva is performed; however, the smell that is emitted <b>after</b> the flame catches and <b>the column of smoke rises is not subject to</b> the prohibition of <b>misuse of consecrated property, since its mitzva has</b> already <b>been performed.</b>",
        "The Gemara asks: <b>Is that to say that</b> in <b>any</b> case <b>where its mitzva has</b> already <b>been performed,</b> the object <b>is not subject to</b> the prohibition of <b>misuse of consecrated property? And the</b> daily <b>removal of ashes</b> of the offerings from the altar occurs after <b>its mitzva has been performed, and</b> the ashes are <b>subject to</b> the prohibition of <b>misuse of consecrated property, as it is written:</b> “And the priest shall put on his linen garment, and his linen breeches shall he put upon his flesh; and he shall take up the ashes of what the fire has consumed of the burnt-offering on the altar, <b>and he shall put them beside the altar”</b> (Leviticus 6:3). The Sages derive from the phrase: “And he shall put them” <b>that he</b> may <b>not scatter</b> these ashes; rather, they should be placed gently. <b>“And he shall put them”</b> also indicates <b>that one</b> may <b>not</b> derive <b>benefit</b> from these ashes.",
        "The Gemara answers: This case does not prove a principle, <b>because the</b> <i>halakhot</i> of <b>removal of ashes</b> from the altar <b>and</b> of <b>the priestly garments</b> worn by the High Priest on Yom Kippur <b>are two verses that come as one.</b> The principle is that <b>two verses that come as one do not teach</b> a principle. In other words, if a <i>halakha</i> is stated twice, with regard to two individual cases in the Torah, the understanding is that this <i>halakha</i> applies only to those cases. Had this <i>halakha</i> applied to all other relevant cases as well, it would not have been necessary for the Torah to teach it twice. The fact that two cases are mentioned indicates that they are the exceptions rather than the rule.",
        "The Gemara delineates the two cases: The <i>halakha</i> of the <b>removal of ashes is that which we said.</b> Where is this <i>halakha</i> stated with regard to <b>the priestly garments? As it is written:</b> “And Aharon shall come into the Tent of Meeting, and shall take off the linen garments, which he put on when he went into the sacred place, <b>and he shall leave them there”</b> (Leviticus 16:23). The phrase: “And he shall leave them” <b>teaches that they require burial.</b> Although their use for the mitzva has been completed, it is prohibited to derive benefit from them.",
        "The Gemara comments: <b>It works out well</b> that there are two cases <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, who say</b> that this verse <b>teaches that they require burial. However, according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Dosa, who disagrees with them</b> and <b>says:</b> These priestly clothes may no longer be used by the High Priest on Yom Kippur, <b>but they are fit</b> for use <b>by a common priest,</b> since these garments are similar to those worn by common priests every day. <b>And what</b> is the meaning of: <b>“And he shall leave them there”?</b> This indicates <b>that</b> the High Priest <b>may not use them on another Yom Kippur.</b> According to this opinion, <b>what can be said?</b> According to the opinion of Rabbi Dosa, there is only one verse that teaches about misuse of consecrated property with an item that has already been used for performing its mitzva. Therefore, it should be possible to derive a principle from the verse dealing with the removal of ashes.",
        "The Gemara answers: A principle cannot be based on this verse, <b>because removal of ashes and the heifer whose neck is broken,</b> from which one may not derive benefit after the ceremony, <b>are two verses that come as one. And two verses that come as one do not teach</b> a principle.",
        "The Gemara asks: <b>It works out well according to the one who said</b> that <b>they do not teach</b> a principle, i.e., according to the Rabbis. <b>However, according to the one who said</b> that <b>they do teach</b> a principle, i.e., Rabbi Yehuda in tractate <i>Sanhedrin</i>, <b>what can be said?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Two</b> phrases indicating <b>exclusions are written</b> with regard to these <i>halakhot</i>, limiting this rule to them. With regard to the removal of ashes <b>it is written: “And he shall put it.”</b> The word “it” limits the <i>halakha</i> to this particular circumstance. With regard to the heifer whose neck is broken <b>it is written: “The</b> heifer <b>which had its neck broken”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:6). The word “the” indicates that this <i>halakha</i> applies only to this type of heifer and not to any other similar case.",
        "After this tangential discussion of the laws of misuse of consecrated property, the Gemara returns to Abaye and Rava’s dispute about the status of unintended benefit, seeking to prove one side or the other. <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof based on what was taught: If <b>one brought</b> the heifer whose neck is to be broken or the red heifer <b>into a cow pen, and it threshes</b> grain while walking with other cows, then <b>it is valid.</b> Under normal circumstances, had one used the heifer for work, it would be disqualified from use in its ceremony. However, in this case, the red heifer may still be burned, and the heifer is still fit to have its neck broken in the ritual. Apparently, the verses “Upon which a yoke has not been placed” (Numbers 19:2) and “Which has not been used for work” (Deuteronomy 21:3) still apply to it, because the owner did not intend for it to work. If he brought it in <b>so that it may nurse</b> from its mother <b>and so it will thresh</b> grain, then <b>it is disqualified</b> from use in these rituals.",
        "<b>And here, isn’t it</b> a case <b>where it was not possible</b> to act differently, as the heifer needs to nurse, <b>and he intended</b> that it thresh the grain? <b>And it is teaching that</b> the heifer <b>is disqualified</b> from use. This proves that when one intends to derive benefit, even if there is no other way to act, it is prohibited to derive benefit. The Gemara rejects this: <b>It is different there, as it is written: “Which has not been used for work” in any case.</b> Therefore, while the heifer is disqualified from use even if the situation was unavoidable, no general conclusion can be drawn from this case.",
        "The Gemara challenges: <b>If so,</b> that this verse means that it has not performed any work at all, then it should apply <b>even to the first clause.</b> Even when it threshes the grain against the will of the owner, it has still done work and should be rendered disqualified."
      ],
      [
        "The Gemara answers. <b>This</b> case <b>is comparable only to that</b> other case: If <b>a bird landed on</b> the red heifer <b>it</b> remains <b>valid,</b> since this is not considered to be like bearing a yoke. If <b>a male</b> animal <b>mounted it</b> to mate with it, <b>it is unfit</b> and may not be used for the ritual. The same applies in this case: When the owner moves the heifer into a pen and it threshes, since the owner is uninterested in this action, it is like the case of the bird and the heifer remains valid. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for the difference between the case where a bird lands on it and where a male animal attempts to mate with it?",
        "<b>Rav Pappa said</b> that the verse says: “And the elders of that city shall take a heifer of the herd, which has not been used for work, and which has not drawn in the yoke” (Deuteronomy 21:3). <b>If it were written: “He worked [<i>avad</i>],” and we read: “He worked [<i>avad</i>],”</b> this word choice would indicate that the heifer could still be used <b>until he,</b> the owner of the heifer himself, <b>used it</b> willingly for labor. <b>If it were written: “It was worked [<i>ubbad</i>],” and we read: “It was worked [<i>ubbad</i>],”</b> it would indicate that <b>even</b> if it performed labor <b>on its own it is also</b> prohibited to use it, since some form of labor had been done with it.",
        "<b>Now that it is written: “He worked [<i>avad</i>],” but we read</b> this word as: <b>“It was worked [<i>ubbad</i>],”</b> both meanings are intended: It is prohibited if <b>it is worked in a similar</b> manner to the way <b>he works.</b> In other words, <b>just as</b> the owner <b>works</b> the animal in a way <b>that is beneficial to him, so too,</b> the animal becomes prohibited only when <b>it is worked</b> in a way <b>that causes him to</b> derive <b>benefit</b> from this labor. Therefore, it still may be used if a bird lands on it, because the owner does not derive benefit from this in any way. However, if a male bull mates with this heifer it is rendered unfit, since the owner generally has an interest in this occurring.",
        "The Gemara cites an additional proof. <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> from that which is taught: If one finds <b>a lost item, he</b> may <b>not spread it out over a bed or over a frame for his</b> own <b>purposes,</b> since this is deriving benefit from an object that does not belong to him. <b>However, he</b> may <b>spread it out over a bed or a frame for its</b> own <b>sake</b> if it requires airing. <b>If guests happen</b> to come <b>to him, he may not spread it out, neither for its sake nor for his</b> own <b>purpose.</b> Apparently, the benefit is unavoidable and intended, as there is no other way for him to care for the lost object, and he benefits from having his guests see the item; nonetheless, it is still prohibited. This seems to prove that Rava’s opinion is correct.",
        "The Gemara rejects this conclusion: <b>It is different there, as</b> he risks <b>damaging it, either due to the evil eye</b> that he casts upon it <b>or due to the thieves</b> who will now know that this valuable item is in his possession and will attempt to steal it. It is not prohibited because of the benefit; rather, it is prohibited due to the concern that he may damage the item.",
        "The Gemara offers a final proof. <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof based on the following mishna: <b>Clothing merchants</b> who sell garments made of diverse kinds, a prohibited mixture of wool and linen, may <b>sell them as they normally would</b> to gentiles. A merchant may place the garments he is selling on his shoulders and need not be concerned about the prohibition against wearing diverse kinds, <b>provided he does not intend</b> to benefit from the garments <b>in the sun</b> as protection <b>from the sun, or in the rain</b> as protection <b>from the rain. However, the modest</b> people, those who are meticulous in their performance of mitzvot, <b>suspend</b> the wool and linen garments <b>on a stick behind them.</b>",
        "<b>And here, isn’t it</b> a case where <b>it is possible</b> for all clothing merchants <b>to act like the modest</b> people and not derive benefit from the mixture of wool and linen? Nonetheless, the mishna states that <b>when one does not intend</b> to benefit from the prohibited item, <b>it is permitted</b> to do so. This presents <b>a conclusive refutation to he who taught the first version</b> of <b>Rava’s</b> statement. According to this version, one is prohibited from deriving benefit when it is possible to avoid doing so and he does not intend to derive benefit. The Gemara concludes: Indeed, it is <b>a conclusive refutation.</b>"

Therefore, based on the same <i>a fortiori</i> inference, the principle: The legal status of its taste is like that of its substance, should apply in this case as well. Similarly, all other prohibitions in the Torah are more severe than the case of a nazirite in one of these aspects, and therefore this principle is universal. In any case, this entire derivation presents a difficulty for Rabbi Yoḥanan, who derives a different <i>halakha</i> from the term: Soaked.",
        "The Gemara answers: In accordance with <b>whose opinion</b> is the previously cited derivation? <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> who derive this <i>halakha</i> from the term: Soaked.

        "The Gemara answers: <b>Rather,</b> the novelty is <b>that if one soaks</b> meat <b>in milk all day, it is permitted</b> by Torah law, despite the fact that the meat certainly absorbed some taste of the milk, whereas if <b>one cooked</b> the meat in milk even for a short time, the mixture <b>is prohibited</b> by Torah law.",

        "<b>Rather, he derives</b> the principle: The legal status of the taste is like that of the substance itself <b>from</b> the required <b>purging</b> of the vessels of <b>gentiles.</b> In the section of the Torah that deals with the spoils of Midian (Numbers 31:21–24), it states that a vessel used by a gentile to cook food must be purged through fire and purified before it may be used by a Jew. <b>Isn’t</b> the <b>purging</b> of vessels of <b>gentiles</b> necessary only to cleanse them from the <b>mere taste</b> that was absorbed through the process of cooking? Even so, these vessels are <b>prohibited</b> if this cleansing was not performed. <b>Here, too,</b> it is <b>no different;</b> the same reasoning applies in all cases.",
        "The Gemara comments: <b>And the Rabbis</b> do not derive this principle from this source, as they maintain that the <i>halakha</i> of <b>purging</b> vessels of <b>gentiles is</b> also <b>a novelty.</b> What is the novelty of this <i>halakha</i>? <b>As</b> in general, <b>anything that contributes taste</b> that renders the food <b>tainted is permitted.</b> If the taste added by the prohibited food does not enhance the permitted food, then as a rule it does not render the permitted substance prohibited. <b>As we derive</b> this principle <b>from</b> the <i>halakha</i> that <b>an</b> unslaughtered <b>animal carcass</b> that is unfit for consumption is not classified as a prohibited animal carcass and is not prohibited. <b>However, here,</b> with regard to the <i>halakha</i> of purging vessels of gentiles, the Torah states that even if they contribute taste that renders the food tainted they are <b>prohibited.</b> If twenty-four hours have passed since food was cooked in a pot, the assumption is that it will contribute a negative taste to any foods cooked in the pot subsequently. Nevertheless, vessels taken from gentiles remain prohibited until they are purged, even though the taste they contribute taints the food.",
        "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how does <b>Rabbi Akiva,</b> who derives this principle from the required purging of the vessels of gentiles, respond to the previous claim? The Gemara explains: He holds <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion subsequently cited in the name of <b>Rav Ḥiyya, son of Rav Huna, who said: The Torah prohibited</b> unpurged vessels of gentiles <b>only in</b> the case of <b>a pot</b> that was used <b>on that day. Therefore, it is not</b> a case where the pot <b>contributes taste</b> that renders the food <b>tainted.</b>",
        "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> what do <b>the Rabbis</b> say about deriving the <i>halakha</i> from a pot used on that day? The Gemara answers: In their opinion, <b>even</b> in the case of <b>a pot</b> used <b>on that day, it is impossible that</b> the vessel <b>does not slightly taint</b> the food absorbed in the vessel. Consequently, the <i>halakha</i> of purging vessels of gentiles is indeed a novel case from which principles cannot be derived.",
        "<b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Avya, said to Rav Ashi: From</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, let us learn</b> the correct interpretation of the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva. Don’t the Rabbis say</b> that the term <b>soaked teaches</b> that the principle that the legal status of <b>taste is like</b> that of <b>substance</b> applies not only to a nazirite, but that <b>from here you derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard <b>to all prohibitions of the Torah? According to Rabbi Akiva as well,</b> the term <b>soaked teaches</b> that <b>the permitted</b> substance <b>joins together with the prohibited</b> substance with regard to a nazirite, and <b>from here you derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard <b>to all prohibitions of the Torah.</b> This explanation is contrary to the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan, who applies this principle only to a nazirite.",
        "Rav Ashi <b>said to him:</b> This cannot serve as a proof,"

        "The Gemara elaborates: The derivation that a permitted substance joins together with a prohibited substance in the case of <b>a nazirite</b> is <b>that which we stated</b> above. With regard to <b>a sin-offering, what is</b> the derivation that permitted material combines with prohibited material? <b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: <b>“Anything that touches in its flesh shall become consecrated”</b> (Leviticus 6:20). I <b>might</b> have thought that non-sacred meat that touched any part of a sin-offering is rendered prohibited <b>even if it did not absorb</b> the taste of the sin-offering it touched. Therefore, <b>the verse states: In its flesh shall become consecrated,</b> to teach that this meat is not consecrated <b>until</b> the taste of the sin-offering <b>is absorbed within its flesh.</b>",
        "The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Shall become consecrated</b> means that <b>its</b> legal status <b>becomes like</b> that of the sin-offering itself; <b>that</b> is, <b>if</b> the sin-offering <b>is disqualified,</b> this meat <b>will</b> also <b>be disqualified. And if</b> the sin-offering <b>is valid,</b> the meat that touched it may <b>be eaten in accordance with the more stringent</b> standards <b>of</b> a sin-offering as far as when and where it may be eaten. The principle that a permitted substance joins together with a prohibited substance applies in the case of a sin-offering as well. Therefore, the principle cannot be extended to the entire Torah, as a <i>halakha</i> stated in two cases is not applied elsewhere.",
        "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> according to <b>the Rabbis as well, let</b> the cases of <b>a nazirite and a sin-offering</b> be considered <b>two verses that come as one and they do not teach</b> the principle that the legal status of taste is like that of the substance with regard to the entire Torah.",
        "The Gemara answers that the Rabbis <b>say:</b> Both of <b>these</b> cases <b>are necessary</b> as they could not have been derived from each other. Therefore, they are not two verses that come as one and it is possible to derive a principle from these two <i>halakhot</i>.",
        "The Gemara asks: <b>And Rabbi Akiva,</b> who does not derive a general principle from these verses, would respond by asking: In <b>what</b> way <b>are</b> they <b>necessary? Granted, if the Merciful One had written</b> this principle only with regard <b>to a sin-offering,</b> one would <b>not derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>a nazirite from it,</b> as <b>we do not derive</b> <i>halakhot</i> of <b>non-sacred</b> objects <b>from</b> those of <b>consecrated</b> objects. Certain stringencies and strictures apply only to consecrated property. <b>However, let the Merciful One write</b> this principle <b>with regard to a nazirite, and you</b> could <b>bring</b> the case of the <b>sin-offering and derive</b> it from the case of a nazirite, just <b>as</b> the application of this principle to <b>all prohibitions in the Torah is derived from</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>a nazirite.</b> Since this principle is stated in both cases unnecessarily, these are two verses that come as one, and one cannot derive a principle from them.",
        "The Gemara asks: <b>And the Rabbis,</b> as they maintain that the principle that the legal status of the taste of a prohibited substance is like that of the substance itself is not limited to these two cases, they would <b>say to you</b> that both sources <b>are necessary.</b> The case of the <b>sin-offering</b> is necessary <b>to</b> derive the principle <b>that a permitted</b> substance <b>joins together with a prohibited</b> substance, as <b>one cannot derive</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>non-sacred</b> food <b>from consecrated</b> property. <b>And</b> the term <b>soaked,</b> which appears in the context of the <i>halakhot</i> of a nazirite, <b>teaches</b> the principle that the legal status of <b>taste is like</b> that of the <b>substance.</b> Since both examples are necessary, they are not considered two verses that come as one, and it is therefore possible to derive a principle from them. <b>And</b> consequently <b>from here you derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard <b>to all of the Torah in its entirety.</b>",
        "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how could <b>Rabbi Akiva</b> respond to this claim? The Gemara answers: Rabbi Akiva would say that <b>both</b> cases teach the principle that <b>a permitted</b> substance <b>joins together with a prohibited</b> substance, <b>and they are</b> indeed <b>two verses that come as one,</b> to teach about the same issue. <b>And</b> the rule is that <b>any two verses that come as one do not teach</b> overarching principles.",
        "<b>Rav Ashi said to Rav Kahana: But</b> with regard to <b>that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse: “He shall eat <b>nothing that is made of the grapevine, from the grape skins to the grape seed”</b> (Numbers 6:4), <b>taught with regard to prohibitions of a nazirite that</b> these substances <b>join together.</b> If the nazirite ate only a small amount of each substance that when joined together constitute the measure that determines liability, he is liable. <b>Now</b> the following question arises: <b>According to Rabbi Akiva,</b> who maintains that <b>prohibited and permitted</b> substances <b>join together, is it necessary</b> to teach that one <b>prohibited</b> substance <b>joins together with</b> another <b>prohibited</b> substance? Apparently, according to Rabbi Akiva’s opinion, this derivation is unnecessary.",
        "Rav Kahana <b>said to him</b> that this derivation is necessary because the two cases are not identical: Whereas <b>prohibited and permitted</b> substances combine only when they are eaten <b>simultaneously, prohibited and</b> other <b>prohibited</b> substances join together even when eaten <b>one after the other.</b> In other words, if a nazirite eats half an olive-bulk of grape skins and then eats half an olive-bulk of grape seeds, he is liable according to Rabbi Akiva."

      "<b>Rav Dimi sat and stated this <i>halakha</i></b> that a permitted substance does not join together with a prohibited substance to constitute the requisite measure, except in the case of a nazirite. <b>Abaye said to Rav Dimi: And</b> is it true that with regard to <b>all</b> other <b>prohibitions in the Torah, a permitted</b> substance <b>does not join together with a prohibited</b> substance?",
      "<b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna: With regard to thick <b>soup</b> prepared <b>with <i>teruma</i></b> produce whose <b>garlic and oil</b> are <b>of non-sacred</b> produce, <b>and one who immersed himself during that day touched some of</b> the ingredients, <b>he disqualified all</b> the contents of the pot, as they are subsumed within the <i>teruma</i> soup. However, if the thick <b>soup</b> was prepared <b>with non-sacred</b> produce <b>and the garlic and the oil were of <i>teruma</i>, and one who immersed himself during that day touched some of them, he disqualifies only</b> the ingredients in the <b>place that he touched.</b>",
      "Abaye continues. <b>And we discussed this</b> issue: <b>Why</b> are the ingredients in the <b>place that he touched disqualified?</b> The <b>spices,</b> i.e., the garlic or oil, <b>are nullified by the majority.</b> Since the major portion of the dish is composed of non-sacred produce, it should not be disqualified by contact with one who immersed himself during that day. <b>And Rabba bar bar Ḥana said</b> in reply: <b>What is the reason</b> that it becomes disqualified? It is <b>since a non-priest is flogged for</b> eating <b>an olive-bulk</b> of the soup, as anything into which <i>teruma</i> is mixed is considered <i>teruma</i> by Torah law. <b>What are the circumstances</b> of this ruling that a non-priest is flogged? Is it <b>not due to</b> the fact <b>that the permitted</b> substance <b>joins together with the prohibited</b> substance?",
      "Rav Dimi rejects this contention: <b>No; what is</b> the meaning of <b>an olive-bulk</b> in this mishna? It means <b>that there is</b> sufficient <i>teruma</i> in the mixture that when one eats from the mixture he will consume <b>an olive-bulk</b> of <i>teruma</i> <b>in the time it takes to eat a half-loaf</b> of bread. In that case one is liable for punishment for eating this olive-bulk, as if he ate the <i>teruma</i> alone.",
      "Abaye asked him: <b>Is</b> eating <b>an olive-bulk in the time it takes to eat a half-loaf</b> of bread prohibited <b>by Torah</b> law, and one is punished for it? He <b>said to him: Yes.</b>",
      "Abaye asked in response: <b>If so, why do the Rabbis disagree with Rabbi Eliezer with regard to</b> eating <b>Babylonian <i>kutaḥ</i>,</b> a dip that contains flour, on Passover? The Rabbis maintain that one is not punished by Torah law for eating a mixture containing leaven. Although the Rabbis do not derive from the word: Anything [<i>kol</i>], that leaven in a mixture is prohibited, they should nonetheless hold one liable for eating an olive-bulk of a prohibited substance in the time it takes to eat a half-loaf of bread.",
      "Rav Dimi said: <b>Rather, what</b> conclusion must be drawn; the reason that a non-priest is flogged for eating the <i>teruma</i> soup is <b>due to</b> the fact that <b>a permitted</b> substance <b>joins together with a prohibited</b> substance? If so, <b>ultimately, why do the Rabbis disagree with Rabbi Eliezer with regard to</b> eating <b>Babylonian <i>kutaḥ</i>? Rather, leave Babylonian <i>kutaḥ</i>, as</b> in eating that mixture <b>there is no</b> possibility that one will consume <b>an olive-bulk</b> of the leaven <b>in the time it takes to eat a half-loaf</b> of bread. <b>If</b> he <b>eats</b> <i>kutaḥ</i> <b>in its pure,</b> unadulterated form, <b>by swallowing it</b> as food, not as a dip, <b>his intention is</b> rendered <b>irrelevant by</b> the opinions of <b>all</b> other <b>people.</b> It is unusual for a person to eat a pungent dip by itself, all the more so, for him to eat it so quickly. One receives no punishment for conduct that anomalous. <b>And if he dips</b> other food into the <i>kutaḥ</i> <b>and eats</b> it, he will <b>not</b> consume <b>an olive-bulk in the time it takes to eat a half-loaf</b> of bread. Due to the pungency of the dip, one needs to add only a small portion to his food.",
      "Abaye <b>raised an objection to</b> Rav Dimi from a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>two pots, one of non-sacred</b> produce <b>and</b> the other <b>one of <i>teruma</i>, before which</b> were <b>two mortars,</b> one in <b>which non-sacred</b> produce was pounded, <b>and one</b> in <b>which <i>teruma</i></b> produce was pounded, <b>and</b> the contents of <b>these</b> mortars <b>fell into these</b> pots, but it is unknown which produce fell into which pot, <b>it is</b> all <b>permitted.</b> The reason for this ruling is <b>as I say,</b> since there is no definitive proof to the contrary, that the <b><i>teruma</i> fell into the <i>teruma</i> and</b> the <b>non-sacred produce fell into</b> the <b>non-sacred produce.</b>",
      "Abaye explains his objection: <b>And if you say</b> that eating <b>an olive-bulk</b> of a prohibited substance <b>in the time it takes to eat a half-loaf</b> of bread is prohibited <b>by Torah</b> law, <b>why do we say</b> this principle: <b>As I say that</b> the <b><i>teruma</i></b> fell <b>into</b> the <i>teruma</i>, <b>etc.?</b> If the <i>teruma</i> produce fell into the pot containing non-sacred produce, one who eats from the mixture will consume an olive-bulk of <i>teruma</i> within the time it takes to eat a half-loaf of bread, and he will thereby violate a Torah prohibition. Rav Dimi <b>said to him: Leave <i>teruma</i></b> separated from <b>spices,</b> which is <i>teruma</i> <b>by rabbinic</b> law. By Torah law one is required to separate <i>teruma</i> only from grain, wine and oil. The Sages are lenient with regard to <i>teruma</i> by rabbinic law.",
      "Abaye <b>raised</b> another <b>objection</b> from a similar <i>baraita</i>: In a case where there are <b>two baskets, one</b> filled with <b>non-sacred</b> produce <b>and the other</b> filled with <b><i>teruma</i>, and before them</b> were <b>two</b> vessels each containing a <b><i>se’a</i></b> of produce, <b>one</b> filled with <b>non-sacred</b> produce <b>and</b> the other <b>one</b> filled <b>with <i>teruma</i>, and these,</b> the contents of each of the baskets, <b>fell into those,</b> each of the <i>se’a</i> vessels. It is possible that the <i>teruma</i> fell into the non-sacred produce, and it is prohibited for non-priests to eat a mixture of <i>teruma</i> and non-sacred produce. Nevertheless, the contents of the <i>se’a</i> vessel containing the non-sacred produce are <b>permitted, as I say</b> that <b>the non-sacred produce fell into the non-sacred produce and the <i>teruma</i> fell into the <i>teruma</i>.</b> The obligation to separate <i>teruma</i> from grain is by Torah law, <b>and if you say</b> that eating <b>an olive-bulk</b> of forbidden food <b>in the time it takes to eat a half-loaf</b> of bread is prohibited <b>by Torah</b> law, <b>why do we say</b> the principle: <b>As I say</b> the non-sacred grain fell into the non-sacred grain? Why aren’t the Sages concerned that one might eat an olive-bulk of <i>teruma</i> in the time it takes to eat a half-loaf, which is prohibited by Torah law?",
      "<b>He said to him: Leave <i>teruma</i> in modern times,</b> as it is in effect <b>by rabbinic</b> law. Once the Jewish people were exiled from their land, the <i>halakhot</i> of <i>teruma</i> and tithes apply by rabbinic law, not Torah law. This is the basis for the lenient ruling in the case of this mixture."

        "The Gemara elaborates. <b>As we learned</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>nine stores</b> in a city, <b>all of which sell</b> kosher <b>meat</b> from <b>a slaughtered</b> animal, <b>and one</b> other store that <b>sells meat</b> from unslaughtered <b>animal carcasses, and</b> a person <b>took</b> meat <b>from one of them and he does not know from which one he took</b> the meat, in this case of <b>uncertainty,</b> the meat <b>is prohibited.</b> This ruling is based on the principle: The legal status of an item fixed in its place is that of an uncertainty that is equally balanced. In this case, when it comes to determining whether or not this meat comes from a kosher store, the two types of stores are regarded as though they were equal in number.",
        "This <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And in</b> the case of meat <b>found</b> outside, <b>follow the majority.</b> If most stores in the city sell kosher meat one can assume that the meat he found is kosher, based on the principle: Any item separated, i.e., not fixed in its place, is presumed to have been separated from the majority. By the same token, if most stores in that city sell non-kosher meat, the meat found is presumed to be non-kosher. These two principles can be applied to the cases involving piles of <i>matza</i> and leaven: If the morsel was separated from the piles when taken by the mouse, follow the majority. However, if the mouse took the morsel from one of the piles, the legal status of the morsel is that of an equally balanced uncertainty concerning whether it was taken from a pile of <i>matza</i> or a pile of leaven, and the owner is required to conduct an additional search.",
        "The Gemara discusses another case: There are <b>two piles, one of <i>matza</i> and one of leavened bread, and before them</b> there are <b>two houses, one</b> which was <b>searched and one</b> which was <b>not searched, and two mice came,</b> and in our presence <b>one took <i>matza</i> and one took leavened bread.</b> Each mouse went into a different house, <b>and we do not know which</b> mouse <b>entered this</b> house <b>and which</b> mouse <b>entered that</b> house.

        "<b>As we learned</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i>: There are <b>two baskets, one</b> filled with <b>non-sacred</b> produce <b>and</b> the other <b>one</b> filled with <b><i>teruma</i>, and before them</b> are <b>two</b> vessels each containing a <b><i>se’a</i></b> of produce, <b>one</b> filled with <b>non-sacred</b> produce <b>and</b> the other <b>one</b> filled with <b><i>teruma</i>.

Nevertheless, the contents of the <i>se’a</i> vessel containing the non-sacred produce <b>is permitted, as I say</b> that <b>the non-sacred produce fell into the non-sacred produce and the <i>teruma</i> fell into the <i>teruma</i>.</b> Likewise, with regard to leaven, presumably the mouse took the leaven into the house that had not been searched, and there is no need to conduct an additional search of the house that was already searched.",
        "The Gemara rejects this comparison: <b>Say that we state</b> and apply the principle: <b>As I say,</b> and assume that everything occurred in a way that preserves the produce in its permitted state"
      ],
      [
        "only with regard <b>to <i>teruma</i></b> that in modern times is sacred <b>by rabbinic law,</b> as the Torah obligation to separate <i>teruma</i> was abrogated after the destruction of the First Temple. However, with regard <b>to leavened bread,</b> which is prohibited <b>by Torah law, do we say</b> that this principle applies? The Gemara responds: <b>Is that to say</b> that <b>the search for leavened bread</b> is required <b>by Torah law? It is</b> a <b>rabbinic</b> ordinance, <b>as by Torah law, mere nullification is sufficient.</b> Since the issue at hand is not the Torah prohibition of leaven but the rabbinic ordinance to search one’s house, this <i>halakha</i> is comparable to the case of baskets of <i>teruma</i> and non-sacred produce.",
        "The Gemara presents another situation: In a case where there is <b>one pile of leavened bread and before it</b> there are <b>two houses</b> that were <b>searched, and a mouse came and took</b> a morsel from the pile, <b>and we do not know if it entered this</b> house <b>or if it entered that</b> house, <b>this is</b> akin to the case of <b>two paths, as we learned</b> in a mishna: There were <b>two paths, one</b> of which was <b>ritually impure</b> due to a corpse buried there, <b>and one</b> of which was <b>ritually pure. And</b> someone <b>walked on one of them,</b> but he does not remember which, <b>and</b> afterward <b>he engaged in</b> handling items of <b>ritual purity,</b> e.g., <i>teruma</i> or consecrated items; <b>and another</b> person <b>came and walked on the second</b> path, and he too does not remember which path it was, <b>and he</b> also <b>engaged in</b> handling items of <b>ritual purity.</b>",
        "<b>Rabbi Yehuda says: If this</b> one <b>asked</b> a Sage <b>by himself, and that</b> one <b>asked</b> a Sage <b>by himself, they are</b> both <b>pure.</b> When considered separately, each person retains his presumptive status of ritual purity. However, if they <b>both</b> came to ask <b>at the same time, they are</b> both <b>ritually impure.</b> Since one of the two certainly passed on the impure path, even though it is uncertain which, both are deemed impure due to that uncertainty. <b>Rabbi Yosei says: One way or another they are</b> both <b>ritually impure.</b>",
        "<b>Rava said, and some say</b> it was <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> who said: If they came <b>at the same time, everyone agrees</b> that <b>they are ritually impure,</b> as even Rabbi Yehuda concedes that this is the <i>halakha</i>. If they came independently, <b>one after the other, everyone agrees</b> that <b>they are ritually pure. They disagree only with regard to</b> a case where one <b>comes to ask about himself and about the other. Rabbi Yosei likens this</b> case <b>to</b> one where they come to ask <b>at the same time, and Rabbi Yehuda likens it to</b> a case where they come <b>one after the other.</b>",
        "The Gemara addresses another case: If one saw a mouse take leaven and there is <b>uncertainty</b> whether the mouse <b>entered</b> a house that was already searched and <b>uncertainty</b> whether the mouse <b>did not enter</b> that house, <b>that is</b> akin to the <i>halakha</i> of ritual impurity in <b>a valley, and</b> is subject <b>to the dispute between Rabbi Eliezer and the Rabbis.</b>",
        "<b>As we learned</b> in a mishna with regard to <b>one who enters a valley during the rainy season,</b> when seeds are sprouting, people do not have permission to wander in the field of another, as they might harm the plants. For the purpose of this <i>halakha</i> a valley in the rainy season is considered a private domain, and there is a general principle that in the case of uncertainty concerning whether or not one contracted ritual impurity in a private domain he is ritually impure. <b>And if</b> there was <b>ritual impurity in a certain field, and one</b> person <b>said: I walked in that place,</b> in the valley, <b>and I do not know whether I entered that field or whether I did not enter, Rabbi Eliezer deems him pure, and the Rabbis deem him impure.</b>",
        "Rabbi Eliezer deems him pure, <b>as Rabbi Eliezer would say:</b> Concerning <b>uncertainty</b> with regard to <b>entry,</b> i.e., whether or not he entered the place, he is <b>ritually pure;</b> however, if one certainly entered the place and the <b>uncertainty</b> is with regard to <b>contact</b> with <b>ritual impurity,</b> he is <b>ritually impure.</b> According to this opinion, the principle with regard to uncertain impurity in the private domain applies only in a case where the uncertainty is with regard to contact. The Rabbis, however, do not distinguish between these situations, as they maintain he is impure regardless of whether the uncertainty is with regard to entry or with regard to contact. This dispute applies to the case of whether or not one is required to conduct an additional search for leaven in a case where there is uncertainty whether or not leaven was taken into the house.",
        "The Gemara discusses another case: If one saw a mouse <b>enter</b> a house with leaven in its mouth <b>and</b> someone <b>searched and did not find</b> any leaven there, this is akin to <b>the dispute between Rabbi Meir and the Rabbis. As we learned</b> in a mishna, <b>Rabbi Meir would say: Any object that has</b> the <b>presumptive status of ritual impurity,</b> i.e., it is certain that an impure object was buried in a particular place, that place <b>forever</b> remains <b>in its ritual impurity,</b> even if it was excavated and the source of impurity was not found, <b>until it becomes known to you where the ritual impurity is.</b> The assumption is that the impurity was not found because the search was not conducted properly.",
        "<b>And the Rabbis say</b> in this case: He continues <b>searching until he reaches bedrock or virgin soil,</b> under which there is certainly no ritual impurity. If he searched that extensively and failed to discover any impurity, it is apparently no longer there. This dispute applies to the aforementioned case involving leaven.",
        "The Gemara analyzes yet another case: If one saw a mouse <b>enter</b> a house with leaven in its mouth <b>and</b> one <b>searched and found</b> a morsel of leaven there, but there is uncertainty whether or not the morsel that he found is the morsel that the mouse took into the house, this would be akin to <b>the dispute between Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>and Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel.</b>",
        "<b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>a field in which a grave was lost,</b> i.e., there is certainly a grave located in the field but its precise location is unknown, <b>one who enters</b> the field <b>is ritually impure,</b> as he might have stepped on the grave. <b>If a grave was</b> later <b>found</b> and marked <b>in</b> the field, <b>one who enters</b> and walks on the other parts of the field <b>is ritually pure, as I say:</b> The <b>grave that was</b> previously <b>lost is</b> the <b>grave that was</b> subsequently <b>found.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: The entire field must be searched,</b> as perhaps the grave discovered is not the one that was lost. This dispute applies to the above case of leaven.",
        "The Gemara discusses another situation: If a person <b>placed nine</b> morsels of leaven <b>and found ten,</b> indicating that mice had added at least one morsel, this is akin to <b>the dispute between Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>and the Rabbis. As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to a person who <b>placed a <i>maneh</i>,</b> one hundred dinars, of second tithe, <b>and found two hundred</b> dinars: Since it is evident that someone came and placed at least one extra <i>maneh</i> there whose status is unclear, the pile is presumed to contain <b>non-sacred</b> money <b>and second-tithe</b> money <b>intermingled with each other.</b> The assumption is that the additional money is non-sacred, and it is impossible to determine which is the non-sacred money and which is the second-tithe money. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi.",
        "<b>And the Rabbis say:</b> It is <b>all non-sacred</b> money. Since someone else was clearly involved, it is possible that he took the <i>maneh</i> and left behind two hundred other dinars. Consequently, it is impossible to identify any of this money as the original <i>maneh</i>. This same reasoning can be applied to the case of leaven. Since there were undoubtedly mice present, it is possible that the mice took the morsels, moved them, and replaced them with other morsels. As a result, the entire house must be searched again.",
        "The Gemara raises the reverse situation. If one <b>placed ten</b> morsels <b>and found nine, this is</b> comparable to the case mentioned in <b>the latter clause</b> of that same <i>baraita</i>, <b>as it was taught</b> in the <i>baraita</i>: If one <b>left two hundred</b> dinars of second-tithe money <b>and found a <i>maneh</i>,</b> presumably, one <b><i>maneh</i></b> from the initial two hundred remains <b>placed, and</b> the other <b><i>maneh</i></b> is <b>taken</b> and missing. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi.",
        "<b>And the Rabbis say,</b> in keeping with their aforementioned opinion: It is <b>all non-sacred</b> money, as the assumption is that whoever took part of the money actually took it all, and this is a different <i>maneh</i>. Since it is different money, it is presumably non-sacred money, not second-tithe money. This dispute applies to the case where one finds fewer morsels of leaven than he left."
